How to live is a collection of life advice. Those advices are classified into Categories and connected between them.

As more advices are related, the harder it gets to establish boundaries about which categories include them or not. Therefore, sometimes the relation of the categories or connections may not be clear.

Try to open your mind while reading them. Keep in mind, this project is unobjective. They are just one of the many ways to live, which may change and evolve in the future the same way it has done in the past.

I am sure you will not agree with some advice, or you will have different points of view. Feel free to share and discuss them. Have a look at the **Contributions** section below to do so. 

These are simply a collection of life tips with the intention to help other people. Try to get the best from them, as with everything you find in life.

## The reason behind

Over time, I have realized that many of the conversations both day-to-day and especially the in-depth ones end up leading to similar interesting life-about topics.

The more I got to these points of view about life, the more connections I saw between them and realized most of them were related.

After a road trip with my brother talking about these life topics (again), I decided to materialize, classify and represent them in some way. I began writing down most of them in a document. However, I soon realized that a simple document was not enough to represent what I had in mind. 

After [creating a way to manage agnostic collections,](https://github.com/reymon359/collman) I started one containing the topics long-time discussed.

This project gathers the advice and knowledge acquired from life itself (books, people, experiences, â€¦) classifying and grouping them in the best way.

## The advice quotes

The quotes on the advice are a way to show how in the past other people have reached the same or similar conclusions.

They add other points of view about the topic and are a great way to discover new authors to read about.

## Contributions

This is an open-source project where feedback is always welcomed. Feel free to open an issue or make a Pull Request on the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/reymon359/how-to-live). There you can comment on how to improve it, suggest fixing a typo, or just share your point of view.

In addition, you can always drop me a private message if you feel like doing so.

## Resources

In the **Resources and acknowledgments** section of some advice, I may mention books I have read. If you want, you can have a look at this project [Book sentences,](https://github.com/reymon359/book-sentences) where I collected the most important sentences from them.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank all the people whose views and advice in real life, the internet, or books, have helped me to see things differently and grow.
