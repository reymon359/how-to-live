## Ramón Morcillo 24-08-2020

These last months I have expressed my thought with a lot of people and most of them have told me they like the way I think and some things I said. I learned all these things from myself, Software Development, books, and other people. The more you live and learn about life you start seeing connections and realizing that everything is related and connected with everything. This is why all the related tags. I want to create a visual map of all of this, maybe using UML.
