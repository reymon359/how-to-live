# Maintain your integrity

What is integrity?

Integrity is the quality of having strong ethical principles that are followed at all times. Honesty and trust are central to integrity, as is consistency. It is the practice of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical principles and values.

Focusing and maintaining your integrity will strengthen relationships with other people. They will trust you more.

Keep up with your values and beliefs. If you don't keep up with them is because you don't truly believe in them. In that case, you need to review them.
