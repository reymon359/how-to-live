# Helping makes you happy

Probably the easiest way to happiness is through helping others. I think it is in human nature. 

The simple and honest gesture of helping others without receiving anything in return. That brings you closer to happiness.

Everyone needs help at something. Just ask and listen to other people to know how you can help them the best way.
