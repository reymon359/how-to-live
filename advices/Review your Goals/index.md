# Review your Goals

Setting up goals is as important as reviewing them from time to time.

From time to time, review how your long-term objectives and what you want to accomplish. Set up reminders to do so.

Split your big goals into smaller ones. Then, review them in different periods. For example, if you have a year goal review it each month, a monthly goal each week, and so on.

To review their means to check if you are on the path to reach them, if you need help or if you are no longer interested in them. 

If you want to pursue new goals, just do it, however, don't abandon every goal you set. Finishing your objectives and goals will give you the motivation to set up new ones.
