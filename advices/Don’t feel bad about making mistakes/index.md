# Don’t feel bad about making mistakes

Don’t feel bad about making mistakes, instead, feel good because next time you will know better how to act in that situation. 

Every time I make a mistake, I do not overthink it, I just say to myself that Its ok and that the next time I will do better.

Things are not black or white, and when you make a mistake is not a mistake, you just did a thing. saying it is a mistake is just based in someone else opinion.

Dont worry about mistakes and past things that can not be solved
