# Don't give more importance to things than they already have

This one is related to cause something unimportant to seem important.

Sometimes we overthink some small issues which makes them appear bigger than they really are.

When you have a problem try to see it from above. If you deep too much into it it will overcome you.

We all sometimes fail and do things wrong. Don't overreact over this, is not the end of the world. Just learn from it for the next time.

Try to not overthink things and let them flow.
