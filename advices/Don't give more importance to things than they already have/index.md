# Don't give more importance to things than they already have

Avoid making unimportant things seem important.

Sometimes we overthink small issues and end up making them appear bigger than they are.

Relativize. When you have a problem, try to see it from above. If you worry too much about it, it will overcome you.

We all sometimes fail and do things wrong. Don't overreact. It is not the end of the world. Learn from it for the next time.

Try to not overthink and let things flow.
