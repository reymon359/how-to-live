# DRY Don't repeat yourself

Don't repeat yourself (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing them with abstractions, or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

Duplication is a waste. Adding additional, unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount of work required to extend and maintain the software in the future.
 
As a lifestyle, this advice is related to avoiding any kind of repetition that you find in your day by day. If you can not avoid it, try to improve it at least. Try not to do the same thing multiple times, but just one and the right way. Also, try to not accumulate items if you do not need them or already have one that fulfills that purpose.

## Quotes

> Foster an environment where it’s easier to find and reuse existing stuff than to write it yourself. If it isn’t easy, people won’t do it. And if you fail to reuse, you risk duplicating knowledge. ― The Pragmatic Programmer from Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
