# The rule of holes

The Rule of Holes simply states that: When you are in one, stop digging.

When you realize you are doing something wrong, the first thing to do is stop doing it.

It's hard to break bad habits. The first step to take is to stop digging deeper into them. Stop doing them.

Be open-minded about the options and solutions you have when you are stuck.

## Quotes

> The first rule of holes is when you’re in one, stop digging. When you’re in three, bring a lot of shovels. — Thomas Friedman

> More times than I can remember I look around and I ask why the hole I'm in looks so strangely familiar. Probably because it looks a whole lot like all the other ones I dug before I got around to digging this one. - Craig D. Lounsbrough

> If you dig a hole and it's in the wrong place, digging it deeper isn't going to help. - Seymour Chwast

## Resources and credits

I read about this rule on the Clean Coder from Robert C. Martin. Among other topics, he mentioned that:

> Professionals avoid getting so vested in an idea that they can’t abandon it and... ...keep an open mind about other ideas so that when they hit a dead end they still have other options.

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear talks about this rule applied to breaking bad habits.
