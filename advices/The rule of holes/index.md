# The rule of holes

The Rule of Holes simply states that: When you are in one, stop digging.

When you realize you are doing something wrong, the first thing to do is stop doing it.

Be open-minded about other options or solutions when you are stuck.

## Quotes

> The first rule of holes is when you’re in one, stop digging. When you’re in three, bring a lot of shovels. — Thomas Friedman

> More times than I can remember I look around and I ask why the hole I'm in looks so strangely familiar. Probably because it looks a whole lot like all the other ones I dug before I got around to digging this one. - Craig D. Lounsbrough

> If you dig a hole and it's in the wrong place, digging it deeper isn't going to help. - Seymour Chwast

## Resources and credits

I read about this rule on the Clean Coder from Robert C. Martin. Among other topics, he mentioned that:

> Professionals avoid getting so vested in an idea that they can’t abandon it and... ...keep an open mind about other ideas so that when they hit a dead end they still have other options.
