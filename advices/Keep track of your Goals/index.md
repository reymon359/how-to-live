# Keep track of your goals

Keep track of the progress of your goals. This way you will see where you are, how much you improved, and what is left to accomplish them.

It will keep you motivated to pursue them and new ones.

When you do so, you are getting self-feedback on how you are doing. It helps you see if you are going in the right direction.

Review them from time to time. Remind yourself to do so if needed.
