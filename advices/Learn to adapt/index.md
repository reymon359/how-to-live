# Learn to adapt

Life is continuously changing. Our environment, the people we interact with, even ourselves.

This change is good to keep growing. Embrace it, adapt to it. Don't try to force things to remain the same.

Technology changes too, in fact, it does faster than other things. Don't complain when is hard to change along with it. Adapt to it.

Be grateful for the change and for being able to adapt to it.

To adapt to change is to be proactive to it.

Adapt to the situation. Sometimes things suddenly change in the short term. For example, a plan to go outside gets ruined because of heavy rain. Adapt to the change, don't complain about it, make the best of it, look for solutions.

> In our personal and professional lives, we are constantly hit with one adversity after the other, most of which we have no control over. But the four things we have total control over is how we react, how we adapt, how we breathe, and how we take action. ― Diamond Dallas Page
