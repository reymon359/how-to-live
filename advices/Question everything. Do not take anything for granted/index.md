# Question everything. Do not take anything for granted

Do not accept answers such as "this is like this because it is like this". Question it. Do not take it for granted.

Look for the truth. The more you question your world, the more you learn about it.

Don't be afraid to ask as much as you need to understand something.

Don’t be afraid of finding out the truth beneath the obvious.

Make sure a commitment is clear before committing to it
