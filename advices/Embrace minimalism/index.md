# Embrace minimalism

Having a minimalism lifestyle means living with what you really need. Focusing on the simple things and removing anything that distracts you from living with intentionality and freedom.

Is also about getting rid of excess stuff and living life based on experiences rather than worldly possessions. Having less things will also free up your life financially.
 
Try to just have what you need to live, if you don't need it, get rid of it, sell it or give it away.
 
If you follow this mindset, you may probably throw away most of your stuff. If some stuff makes you happy, and what to keep them, just do it.
 
Minimalism can be applied not only to the physical world, but also the digital one or even topics like communication or work. In all of them, the point is the same: Keep things simple, get rid of excess and focus on the important.

## Quotes

> “There are two ways to be rich: One is by acquiring much, and the other is by desiring little.” - Jackie French Koller, 1948.  

> “Simplicity involves unburdening your life, and living more lightly with fewer distractions that interfere with a high quality life, as defined uniquely by each individual.” - Linda Breen Pierce, 1947.

> “One of the advantages of being born in an affluent society is that if one has any intelligence at all, one will realize that having more and more won’t solve the problem, and happiness does not lie in possessions, or even relationships: The answer lies within ourselves. If we can’t find peace and happiness there, it’s not going to come from the outside.” - Tenzin Palmo, 1943.

> “Any half-awake materialist well knows – that which you hold holds you.” – Tom Robbins, 1936.

> “My goal is no longer to get more done, but rather to have less to do.” ― Francine Jay

> “The first step in crafting the life you want is to get rid of everything you don't.” ― Joshua Becker

> “You have succeeded in life when all you really want is only what you really need.” — Vernon Howard

> “It is preoccupation with possession, more than anything else, that prevents men from living freely and nobly.” — Bertrand Russell
