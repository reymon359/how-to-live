# Set up goals

From time to time, think about your future. Think about what you want to achieve in life, where you want to be, how you want to be.

Then set up goals to reach it.

Split those goals into smaller ones to measure them better. Then plan how to accomplish the smaller ones. Book time for them.

Don't be afraid of big goals. You will reach them if you are constant. Little by little.

Maybe the goals are not clear. however, is better to have an idea of them than not having goals at all.

If you want to accomplish something, try to remind yourself, set up reminders.
