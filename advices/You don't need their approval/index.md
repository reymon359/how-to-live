# You don't need their approval

Think for yourself, what you want to do and what makes you happy. Then try to achieve it, even if not everyone approves it.

As long as you are not hurting anyone, and you do things from a kind perspective. If someone has a problem with what you do or who you are is their issue.

When getting opinions from others, listen to them. However, don't do things just to impress others or because others told you it was better. Do it, because you want to do it.

Just because the society or group you are in does something, doesn't mean you have to do it too. Have integrity and be yourself. If you don't want to do it, just don't.

If you want to do something, just do it. You will find a way.
