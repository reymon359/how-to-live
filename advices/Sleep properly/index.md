# Sleep properly

We need to rest properly to keep up with all the daily activities. Try to sleep what is enough for you, which commonly is around 8 hours. However, you may need less or more depending on your habits, age, etc. Listen to your body if you need more or less sleep.

Avoid using the phone right before going to sleep. Is easy to fall into the trap of browsing social media before going to sleep and waste sleeping time on it.

Here are some tips about Sleep Optimization:
- Stop watching blue-light devices like your smartphone for at least 1-hour before going to bed. If not, your mind will be too excited when trying to sleep.
- Try to wake up with light, either sunlight or an alarm that fakes it. It is the human natural behavior. Your mind will leave the deep-sleep zone slow, which is healthier than fast.
- Have the last meal at least 3 hours before going to bed. Therefore, your body will be more relaxed instead of working to digest it
- Sleep in a room as dark as possible. It will help you have a deeper sleep and avoid distractions.
- Have a nice room temperature. Not too cold or too hot. This depends on each one's body's temperature.
