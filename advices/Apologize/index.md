# Apologize

Apologize means _to express regret for something that one has done wrong._

Apologizing is the right thing to do if you did something wrong to someone.

Although it may not completely solve the problem, it will help to solve it.

Both sides will feel better after it.

It’s never too late, so if you want to apologize for something that happened in the past, you still can do it. Just do it if you want to.

Be honest when you are apologizing. Tell the truth of why you are sorry. Usually it's better not to apologize than to fake it or make an excuse.

It can happen that the other person doesn't want to forgive you. It's ok, respect their choice. You did the right thing apologizing, and that is important.

It can be hard if you are not used to. In that case, just begin with an "I'm sorry" and let yourself go. With time, you will get better at it.
