Stop thinking you will get better at something magically. You have to work hard to accomplish it.
 
The key is not about doing a lot, it is about being constant and practicing a bit now and then.
 
If you want to master something in life, you have to practice it. Anything. Little by little.
 
If your goal is to improve at something, you have to practice it.
 
It is true that some people are more capable than others to do some kind of things. However, if you practice enough you can reach them if you really want to.
 
Plan and book time to practice.
