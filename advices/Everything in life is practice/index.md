Stop thinking you will get better at something magically. You have to work on it to accomplish it.
 
If you want to master something in life, you have to practice it. Anything. Little by little. The key is not performing a lot, it is about being constant and practice a bit now and then.
 
It is true that some people are more capable than others to do some kind of things. However, if you practice enough, you can reach them, even surpass them if you really want to
 
To make sure you will practice, plan and book a time to do so.
