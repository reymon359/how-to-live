# Avoid the phone when going to sleep

Don't bring the phone to the bed before going to sleep.

You will excite your brain and will be harder for you to sleep after.

Is easy to fall in to the trap of browsing social media before going to sleep and waste sleeping time on it.

If you can't sleep, instead of using the phone try to read or do more exercise during the day.

When waking up try not to grab the phone to use it as the first thing.

Try not to go in to the phone when you just wake up. Have a shower, breakfast or your usual morning activities before reaching it.

These will help you sleep more and better.
