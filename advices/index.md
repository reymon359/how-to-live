name: 'How to live'

How to live is a collection of life advice. Those advices are classified into Categories and connected between them.

Please keep in mind this is a very subjective project. Maybe the relation of some categories or connections with each may not be as clear as with others. As more advices are related, the harder it gets to establish boundaries about which categories include them or not.

Try to open your mind while reading them. They are just a personal way to see and live, which may change and evolve in the future the same way it has done in the past.

I am sure, and hope, you may not agree with some advice and have different points of view. Feel free to share and discuss them. Have a look at the **Contributions** section below to do so. 

I hope these life tips help other people in some way. Try to get the best from them, as with everything you find in life.

## The reason behind

Over time, I have realized that many of the conversations both day-to-day and especially the deepest ones end up leading to certain topics.

The more I got to these topics and points of view about life, I began seeing connections and realizing that everything was related.

At some point, I decided that I wanted to materialize, classify and represent all of them in some way. After a road trip with my brother with plenty of conversations about those topics, I began writing down most of them in a document. However, I soon realized that a simple document was not enough to represent what I had in mind. 

After [creating a way to make agnostic collections with classifications,](https://github.com/reymon359/collman) I started one containing what I wanted to share.

Since then, I have been collecting the advice and knowledge acquired from life itself (books, people, experiences, â€¦) classifying and grouping them in the best way.

## Why quotes?

The quotes on the advice are a way to show how other people have reached the same or similar conclusions in the past.

They add similar points of view about the topic and are a great way to discover new authors to read about.

## Contributions

## Resources

In the **Resources and acknowledgments** section of some advices, I mention books I have read. If you want, you can have a look at this project [Book sentences,](https://github.com/reymon359/book-sentences) where I collected the most important parts and sentences from them.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all those people whose views and advice in real life or through other ways, like the internet or books, have helped me to see things differently and grow.
