These last months I have expressed my thought with a lot of people and most of them have told me they like the way I think and some things I said. I learned all these things from myself, Software Development, books, and other people. The more you live and learn about life you start seeing connections and realizing that everything is related and connected with everything. This is why all the related tags. I want to create a visual map of all of this, maybe using UML.

Most people spend their lives complaining about things they don’t like.
So, you’re adding power to it.
You’re giving it chi.
We’re supposed to focus on what it is that we’re wanting to move towards instead of away from.

You don’t have to lie when something is bad.
You know, if you have a cold and someone says, “Are you sick?” that doesn’t mean say, “No.”
It means say, “I’m getting better minute by minute.”
