# Ask for forgiveness, not permission

Sometimes is better to take the initiative and do it instead of await for permission.

This applies if the thing you are about to do does not harm anyone. Be kind when doing it.

If what you did was not well seen, apologize.

It's not about doing things that are illegal or immoral. It is about not waiting for anyone else's approval to do the things you need to do in order to succeed or just get things done.
