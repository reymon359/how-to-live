# Ask for help

When you can not do something, ask for help. There is nothing wrong with recognizing our limits.

Be proactive. At first, look for yourself if you can solve the problem you face. If not, ask for help.

Be honest. Better to ask for help on time than not to comply with what you promise.

If someone else needs help, offer yours to them.

Don't be afraid of feeling weak for it. You are brave when you ask for help.

If you are stuck and need help on a task, update others about it.

Use nowadays technology. Ask for help on the internet if people around you can not help you.

Take care of your health. If you don't feel good, ask for medical help. Go to the doctor.

Working in team situations made me realize it is much better to ask for help and keep others updated about how you are doing than to wait and let the "ball of poo" get bigger and bigger until it explodes.
