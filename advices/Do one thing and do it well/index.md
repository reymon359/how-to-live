# Do one thing and do it well

Do not try to do many things, focus on one and dedicate your effort to it.

When you try to do a lot of things, you end up doing nothing, or at least nothing well done.

Pay attention to the details. Seek excellence in what you are doing.

Avoid distractions and pay attention to what you are doing. Use techniques like the Pomodoro timer.
