# Most religions have great values

No matter in what you believe or if you believe at all, respect what others believe in.

Be open-minded about people's beliefs and communities' religions.

Most religions are based on kindness and love towards a community. You can learn from these values in order to be a better person, even if you don't believe.

You may disagree with some practices or beliefs. You don't need to believe in all of them, just be open-minded and respect them. Try to get the best from it.

Travel to see other religions and research about them to understand them better.
