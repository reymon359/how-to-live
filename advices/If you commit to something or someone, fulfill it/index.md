# If you commit to something or someone, fulfill it

When you commit to something, you are making a promise. A promise that you will do it.

If you make a promise, you should fulfill it. It is a matter of being honest with yourself and with the other person you have committed to.

Communicate, update often the other person about your commitment. No matter if it is going well or bad. The important thing is to avoid surprises about it.
