# Do not accumulate useless things

If you aren't going to use something anymore, don't keep it. Give it to someone else, or just remove it from your life.

If you keep it, you will have to take care of it. You will be dependent on it.

Review from time to time what you have and if there are things you no longer use.

Have a minimalist mentality.
