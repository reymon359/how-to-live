# Have ownership of what you do

When you do or create something, take care of it. If it goes well, make sure it keeps going that way and improve it. If it goes bad, be responsible and try to solve it.

This is more important when other people depend on what you do.

If you commit to doing something, be responsible for that commitment and fulfill it.

You are responsible and dependent on your actions. Be aware of it before doing something.
