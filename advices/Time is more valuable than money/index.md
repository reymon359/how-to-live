# Time is more valuable than money

Always think if certain action is worth the time in exchange of the money you will get from it. 

Like a job

When doing things to obtain money like for example selling an item you no longer use, always think if the time you are going to spend on selling it is less valuable than the money you are going to obtain from selling it. If it is not just give it away or share it with others.
