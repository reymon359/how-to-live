# Time is more valuable than money

The amount of money you can have in life can increase or decrease. However, we all have an amount of time to live fixed.

When comparing time with money, try to think if the time you are going to spend doing something is worth the money you will get from it.

For example, when looking for a job. If you have the chance, think about whether the time, effort, and conditions are worth the money. If not, try to improve it or look for a better one.

Sometimes the time spent trying to sell something is not worth the money you will get from it. Give it away or throw it in that case.
