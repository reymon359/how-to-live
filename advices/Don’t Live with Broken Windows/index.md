# Don’t live with broken windows

The broken windows' theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes.
 
If you make mistakes and don't fix them or don't care about them, you will be making more in the future.
 
When disorder increases in software, we call it “software rot.” Some folks might call it by the more optimistic term, “technical debt,” with the implied notion that they’ll pay it back someday. They probably won’t.
 
Don’t leave “broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a “Not Implemented” message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.
 
Don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort. One broken window is one too many. One broken window is all it takes to start the decline.
 
The problem is to make a mistake and keep doing it while you know it is wrong.
