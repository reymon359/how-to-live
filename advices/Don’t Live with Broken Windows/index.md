# Don’t Live with Broken Windows

Don’t Live with Broken Windows. Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.

The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes.

If you make mistakes and don't fix them or don't care about them you will be making more in the future

When disorder increases in software, we call it “software rot.” Some folks might call it by the more optimistic term, “technical debt,” with the implied notion that they’ll pay it back someday. They probably won’t.

Don’t leave “broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a “Not Implemented” message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

Don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort. One broken window is one too many. One broken window—a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the duration of the project—is all it takes to start the decline.

If you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up.

The problem is to make a mistake or doing something wrong and keep doing it while you know it is wrong.
