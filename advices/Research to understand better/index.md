# Research to understand better

When you don't understand something fully, research it.

Understand something properly before starting to interact with it. For example, read the documentation of an item before starting to use it. Or research about a country's culture and traditions before traveling to it.

Nowadays, we can easily access a lot of information thanks to the internet. Take advantage of this and don't hesitate to look for information to understand something better.

Be curious. It is easier to remain in the comfort zone and just know enough to keep going. Step outside that comfort zone and research. 

If you are in a conversation and struggle to understand something, ask questions.

When you don't have time to research something, note it down to do it later.
