# Let others do what they want

All of us are different and want to do different things in life. This diversity is beautiful. Don't try to impose your ideas or opinions on others. 

When you are in a group, planning something take this into account. Reach an agreement that satisfies others, not just yourself.

Open your mind. It is as easy as respecting other people's opinions.
