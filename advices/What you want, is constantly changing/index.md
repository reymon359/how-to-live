# What you want is constantly changing

It may sound pretty obvious, but sometimes it is hard to realize that we are constantly changing and growing, and our interests change as we do so.

You probably don't watch the same kind of movies as you did when you were younger, or eat the same kind of food and the same quantity. You may not even listen to the same music. And all of this is completely normal.

Even today, the things you want maybe are not the same as yesterday.

This situation sometimes makes it hard to make decisions. However, remember that no choice is wrong or right.

Just realize about it, don't worry, and let things flow. Enjoy the moment you are right now and focus on the things you want at that moment.

Having a talk with my friend, Pablo Llorca, made me realize this in a deep way.
