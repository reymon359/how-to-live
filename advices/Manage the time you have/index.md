# Manage the time you have

Time is a finite resource we have, and it is probably the most valuable one. Take advantage of it by managing it properly. Some priorities and benefits would be:

- Setting priorities and goals.
- Spending the time more consciously.
- Reduce the time spent on non-priorities.
- Working in an environment more productive and effective.

Manage the time you spend in different categories such as work, social life, family, hobbies, health, personal interests, and other commitments, to give some examples.

There are plenty of tools to help us manage time more efficiently, like the “Pomodoro Technique” or the “Eisenhower Matrix”

Book time for planning. Try to spend a bit of time each day to plan the next day, and a bit of time each week to plan the next one.
