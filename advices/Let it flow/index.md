# Let it flow

This one is about feeling calm and not worrying. It is key when facing most problems in life. There are things that we can not control or predict, and it is not worth it to worry about them.

When I was in Morocco my favorite saying was _Insha'Allah_ which means "if God wills" or "God willing". It was a religious way of saying _let it flow_ and sounded so good.

Don't overthink or over plan things. Plan a bit and let them flow. Nothing ends up being as planned, so just plan the necessary and then adapt to the situation.

Let each one do what they want. Let plans flow and open your mind to other people's likes and opinions. You will learn and grow.

The Lion King's classic saying "Hakuna Matata" is another way to express this.
