# Respect yourself

To effectively respect others, we first have to respect ourselves.

Respect your feelings, what you really want, what you like, how you look, etc.

Respect your body. Take care of it eating healthy, exercising, and not taking harmful substances. 

If you don't respect yourself, you will hardly respect others.

The better you know yourself, the easier it will be to respect yourself.

Respecting yourself and loving yourself go hand in hand.
