# Optimize your stuff

Optimizing your stuff means not having objects you don't need. No extra stuff or unnecessary items.

If you have two or more items that accomplish the same purpose, get rid of the extra ones and keep the minimum.

Don't buy more things than the ones you need.

Check the things you own from time to time and get rid of whatever you no longer need.

Don't only focus on things. Optimize the way you do them. Think from time to time about the habits you have. Look for ways to do things better.

## Quotes

> We are all tasked to balance and optimize ourselves. - Mae Jemison

> Engineers love to optimize problems. Now I optimize logistical problems. I ask: 'What's the goal? What are our constraints? What is the optimal, elegant way to get to that goal within those constraints?' I break it down in terms of a data funnel: 'Where in the funnel are we inefficient?' That analytical background really helps. - Ruchi Sanghvi
