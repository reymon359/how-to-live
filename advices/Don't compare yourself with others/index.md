# Don't compare yourself with others

Don't compare yourself with others, just with yourself. Compare yourself with the person you were yesterday and with the person you are today. Focus on being a better version of yourself.

People often compare themselves to others to determine how well they are doing in life and base their personal value on that.

Open your mind. Everyone is on a different path, and there are people who are doing better or worse off than you.

By comparing yourself to others, you are holding yourself back.
