# Learn to forgive

To forgive is to change the negative feelings that you have about a fact for positive ones.

When you forgive someone, you are not just helping the other person, but yourself. You're being freed from all resentment.

Learn also to forgive yourself. You are not perfect, none of us is. We make mistakes like everyone else. Accept them and learn from them.

Forgiving is the solution to most problems. Therefore, the earliest you forgive, the earliest the problem gets solved.

If you have a problem with someone you really love and can be solved by forgiving, do it. It's never worth being upset.

Forgive a second time if necessary. However, be careful forgiving the same mistake more than twice. In those situations, just forgiving may not be the best solution.
