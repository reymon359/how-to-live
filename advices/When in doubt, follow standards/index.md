# When in doubt, follow standards

Thanks to the standards, humanity has reached the stability with which most of us currently live.

I follow this advice when doing software development and don't know enough about a topic, library, language, framework, etc.

When in doubt of how to do something, search for the standard way to do it and follow it.

When following standards also think a bit for yourself if what you are following makes sense.

Have an open mind, the standards of your community are not the same as other communities.
