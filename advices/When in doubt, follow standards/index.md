# When in doubt, follow standards

The society we live nowadays has not been always like this. Not so long ago, in human history, the world was much unsafe. It still is in some parts of it. Thanks to civilization and having standards, humanity has reached the stability with which most of us currently live.

Standards are a set of references or rules that a community has agreed to follow.

When in doubt of how to do something, search for the standard way to do it and follow it.

While following standards also think by yourself if what you are following makes sense.

Have an open mind, the standards of your community may not be the same as other communities.

## Resources and credits

I follow this advice when doing software development and I don't know enough about a topic, library, language, or framework.

We had a great discussion with my Master's Degree teacher Luis Fernandez Muñoz about this topic.
