# Trust others

When you don't know someone, trust them by default. Generally speaking, people won't do harm to you.

The more you trust others, the better you can delegate tasks to them.

Anyway, always listen to your body and trust your instincts before trusting someone.

Be honest and kind if you want others to trust you too.
