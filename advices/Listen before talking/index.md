# Listen before talking

In a conversation, try to always listen before speaking. In fact, just speak if it is totally necessary.

Respect what other people are saying. Open your mind. Nobody thinks the same way as you.

The best way to listen is by asking.

While listening, make sure you truly understand the topic and the other participants' feelings about it before giving your opinion.
