# Be grateful

Be grateful for everything:

- What you are.
- What you have.
- Family and friends.
- Nature.
- Food.
- ... Literally everything.

Realizing about these things and spending time thinking about the good things in your life will make you happier.

If someone does something to help you, show them gratitude.
