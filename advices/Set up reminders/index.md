# Set up reminders

We have a memory limit. We can not remember everything we have to do and all the important things, It's impossible.

Thankfully, we live in an age where it is easier than ever to take notes at any moment and set up reminders to abstract ourselves from remembering the important things.

If there is something important you have to do, set up a reminder for it.

Even the smallest things that you think you will remember by yourself.

A reminder can be a to-do in a to-do list, an alarm, or whatever works better for you. Adapt to the new technologies and get the advantage of them.

The point is to help you accomplish all those things you want to.

When you set up reminders, you are delegating the remembering.
