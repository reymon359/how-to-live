# Set up reminders

We, as humans, have a memory limit. We can not remember everything we have to do and all the important things, It simply is not possible.

Thankfully, we live in an age where it is easier than ever to take notes at any moment and set up reminders to abstract ourselves from remembering the important things.

If there is something important you have to do, set up a reminder for it.

Even the smallest things you think you will remember to do by yourself. Set reminders for them too. And once you have the habit of doing them, remove that reminder.

A reminder can be a to-do in a to-do list, an alarm, or whatever works better for you. Try to automate them. Adapt to the new technologies and get the advantage of them.

When you set up reminders, you delegate yourself from remembering things and just focus on doing them.
