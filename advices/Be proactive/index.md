# Be proactive

If you want to do something, just do it, don't wait for it to happen by itself. Don't make up excuses to don't do it.

Take responsibility for your reaction to your experiences. Take the initiative to respond positively, and improve the situation. 

Don't sit and wait in a reactive mode, waiting for problems to be solved by themselves instead of taking action.

The world owes you nothing. You only deserve what you have worked for and achieved by your own effort.
