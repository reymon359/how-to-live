# Offer your help

Always offer to help others. Be there for them.

If you really can do something to help someone, just do it.

Help as much as you can, always taking care of yourself too. If you end up in a bad position, you will not be able to help anymore.

Helping others will make you feel fulfilled and happier.

When I help someone and see how they are better after something I did, that makes me feel really happy.
