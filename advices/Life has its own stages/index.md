# Life has its own stages

The things you like, do, eat, exercise, …. when you are 15 are not the same when you are 30.  There are life stages and we pass through them, everyone has their life stages, and pass through them at different times. Do not expect people to do, like, … the same stuff as you just because you have a similar age. And as with everything learn from other people stages, try to get the best about what they do, like, … in addition share and provide them with your experience and advice on them.

You are not the same person as yesterday. And you can not expect to be the same as you were in the past.
