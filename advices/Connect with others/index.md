# Connect with others

Connect and communicate with other people. The ones you already know and new ones.

Open your mind to meet new people that can offer you new points of view and experiences.

We are born and die alone, and we need to learn to be alone. 
However, as humans, we like social interaction, and it is in our nature to look for it. Connecting with other people and establishing communities make us grow.

Travel to new places to meet new people.

## Quotes

> “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” ― John Lennon

> “We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men; and among those fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects.” ― Herman Melville

> “A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.” ― Albert Einstein

> “The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention…. A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words.” ― Rachel Naomi Remen
