# Respect others beliefs

We all live in the same planet but have born in different societies with different religions and cultures.

You can not expect other people to believe in the same things as you.

Try to respect ther beliefs. Open your mind and try to understand them.

There are a lot of religions out there. When you travel, you may not agree with the practices of other people based on their religion, however you should respect them.

However, no matter what they believe, never do something that hurts another person.
