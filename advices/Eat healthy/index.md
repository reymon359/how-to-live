# Eat healthy

Take care of your body. What you eat has big effects on your health and quality of life. Have a healthy diet to avoid health issues.

Don't be afraid of trying new diets. Open your mind to new healthy foods that will surprise you, and you may end up liking them.

Don't follow a very strict diet, enjoy unhealthy food if you want. Just try to do it with less frequency.

If you don't know how to eat healthy or what you should eat, ask for help. Go to the doctor and research about keeping a healthy diet.
