# Be honest

Always go with the truth.

If you communicate with someone don't lie to them.

If you say the truth the majority of problems won’t appear.

No matter how bad is the truth if the other person finds out later that you were lying it will be worse.

Being honest is about keeping up with your integrity.

When you are honest with someone you build trust with them.
