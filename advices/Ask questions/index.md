# Ask questions

Asking questions is the best way to communicate and get to know someone.

The more you ask, the more you will know about an issue. Ask questions until you have no doubts and everything is clear. This way you will find a solution easier.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you don’t understand something.

Listen properly to the answer. This mean to pay as much attention you can to it. The better you listen, the more you will understand. Don't be afraid to ask more than once if you didn't understand something.
