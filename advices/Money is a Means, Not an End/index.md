# Money is a Means, Not an End

Money is just something you use to accomplish other things.

Money is a means that allows us to reach our end goals.  The reason you hear people say that money can’t buy happiness is because those people whose ideal was to have more and more money were disappointed.  Money in and of itself doesn’t bring you fulfillment.
