# Set up social goals

Set up goals to improve social relationships with others. Think about how you can improve your relationship with friends, relatives, coworkers, etc.

If you want to keep in contact and improve a relationship with someone, remember to talk to them and don't lose contact even in the distance. Set up reminders if needed.
