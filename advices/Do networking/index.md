# Do networking

Seek to connect with people who can - in the future - help you grow.

You don't have to force yourself to do it. Just communicate and connect with other people, you will find new opportunities if you pay attention.

Beware, a networking relationship is not always a friendship relationship, sometimes, they can be exclusive.

If you are interested in a topic, search for a community and events about it. Meet other people with the same interests as yours.
