# The five whys

Five whys (or 5 whys) is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.

Whenever you want to understand something deeply ask why 5 times (or more if needed).

It will help you understand the problems better to reach a solution.
