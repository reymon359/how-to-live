# Buy just what you need

When you are going to buy something, ask yourself if you really need it. Also, think if you will still need it in the long term.

Maybe you already have something similar that fulfills that function.

Try to postpone buying it for a week or a month and find out if you still need it.

Find the balance between something you need and something that makes you happy. If something makes you really happy and not just better at the moment, then buy it.
