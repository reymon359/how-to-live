# Don't overthink

To overthink is to think about something you have already thought. It is a waste of time and energy. It immobilizes you.

Sometimes we overthink about things that don't depend on us. Try to communicate with the people those things depend on to solve them. Ask for help if you need to.

When we overthink too much about doing something, or we plan it without taking action, we are suffering _Analysis Paralysis._
