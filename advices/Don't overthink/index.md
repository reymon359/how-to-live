# Don't overthink

Overthinking stuff. Most of the problems are due to a lack of communication, if you have a problem with someone and you are overthinking just talk with them, tell them the truth about how you feel. Try to find a solution together. There is no bad outcome of this, you either find a solution or clear up your mind although things remain the same.
