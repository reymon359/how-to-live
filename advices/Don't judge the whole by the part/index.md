# Don't judge the whole by the part

You cannot judge a group of people by one person from it.

The same goes by judging a person just for being part of a country, group, community, ... All of us are different and have different opinions and beliefs.

This applies to not just people. Just because you have visited a city from a country, you can not judge the whole country. Or, just because you tried a meal from a country, you shouldn't dislike the whole country's food.

Try new things and look for new experiences to open your mind.
