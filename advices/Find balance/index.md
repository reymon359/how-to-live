# Find balance

Moderation and balance is the key point to enjoy life.

In almost every life topic, you have to balance it. For example, doing exercise or eating. Too many of them are unhealthy, but the same goes for too few. You have to find the balance between both that better suits your needs.

The more you know yourself, the easier it is to find the balance in things you need.

You won't find the balance on the first try. Give it time and keep trying little by little.

Unfortunately, if you don’t keep the balance, they can be lost like sand through your fingers.” ― Fennel Hudson,
