# Book leisure time

Book leisure time to relax and do things alone or with friends.

When you are working, rest from time to time. Book moments for it. For example, use the [Pomodoro technique.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Let things flow and adapt to situations. Sometimes leisure plans you want to do appear, but you have planned other things. However, if you want to do them, just do them.

You can recover that work-time in the future, however the opportunity of that activity may not be repeated.

Disconnecting from time to time will make you feel less stressed and happier.

Be careful and don't confuse Leisure with Procrastination.
