# Book leisure time

Book leisure time to relax and do things alone or with friends.

When you are working, rest from time to time, book moments for it. Use the [Pomodoro technique.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Let things flow and adapt to situations. Sometimes leisure plans you want to do appear but you have not planned them. If you want to do them just do them.

You can recover that work-time in the future however the opportunity of that activity may not be repeated.

You will feel less stressed and more happy.

Be careful and don't confuse Leisure with Procrastination.
