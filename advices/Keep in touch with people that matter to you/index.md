# Keep in touch with people that matter to you

As humans, we tend and need to socialize. We want and need to communicate with other people. 

Of all the people we interact with, some of them are more united to us. The ones we have a closer relationship with and feel are more important to us.

Don't forget to keep in touch with them. Even if you can not see each other, at least keep the contact in the distance. 

Set a reminder to contact them from time to time if needed.
