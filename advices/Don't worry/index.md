# Don't worry

When you worry about something, you are just wasting your present time. 

There is nothing to worry about! Absolutely nothing. You can spend the rest of your life, beginning right now, worrying about the future, and no amount of your worry will change a thing.

Try not to worry and learn to let things flow. Rather than worrying about what will happen, adapt to the situation when it happens.

Don't worry what people say or what people think. Be yourself.

One of the best ways to stop worrying is to be proactive: make a decision and take action.

## Resources and acknowledgments

Chapter 5 "The Useless Emotions — Guilt and Worry" from Wayne Dyer's Your Erroneous Zones. Here are some sentences from it I that collected on my project [Book Sentences](https://github.com/reymon359/book-sentences)

> Worry is... ...being immobilized in the present as a result of things that are going or not going to happen in the future.
>
> You must be careful not to confuse worrying with planning for the future. If you are planning, and the present-moment activity will contribute to a more effective future, then this is not worry. It is worry only when you are in any way immobilized now about a future happening.
> 
> Worry is endemic to our culture. Almost everyone spends an inordinate amount of present moments worrying about the future. And all of it is for naught.
>
> Not one moment of worry will make things any better. In fact, worry will very likely help you to be less effective in dealing with the present.
>
> View your present moments as times to live, rather than to obsess about the future... ...When you catch yourself worrying, ask yourself, “What am I avoiding now by using up this moment with worry?” Then begin to attack whatever it is you’re avoiding
