# Be punctual

when you agree to meet someone at a certain time you are making a promise.

If you are not in time is like lying to the other person

bad for your integrity

 
> Managing lateness. The trick to managing lateness is early detection and transparency... ...regularly measure your progress against your goal... ...Be as honest as you can about all dates. Do not incorporate hope into your estimates! - The clean coder

> being on time is already being late, someone

anyway if you are waiting for someone try to enjoy the moment rather than getting upset, enjoy where you are, think or plan something for later, whatever
