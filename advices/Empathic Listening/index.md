# Empathic listening

Empathic listening is about listening with your eyes and with your heart. Listen to understand not only what is being said but the feelings and meaning of it.
You listen the behavior and feel the same way as the speaker.

Try to listen this way when you are communicating with someone.

Emphatic listening is above just listening. It achieves making an emotional connection with the other person.

It is also called active listening or reflective listening.
