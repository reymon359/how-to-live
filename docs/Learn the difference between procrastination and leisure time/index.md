# Learn the difference between procrastination and leisure time

Sometimes you can feel bad in your free time thinking that you are procrastinating.

It is hard to differentiate whether we are spending leisure time or if we are procrastinating. This can make us feel bad because we think we are procrastinating, and we don't enjoy that leisure time.

Suppressing leisure in hopes that you will get more done will not make you more productive. When you avoid your nasic need for leisure, you will lose control and instead of taking just a few minutes between tasks, you will find yourself browsing social media for hours.

You have to set time aside for leisure activities, even if you have a lot of work to do. If you work for too long you will soon become uninspired and it will be hard to focus.

Use planning and time management techniques like the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

In the end is hard to discern between both. In the end is about how you feel. You know deep inside yourself when you are procrastinating. You feel like you shouldn't be doing what you are doing or in other words, avoiding what you should be doing. If you are already doing it, let it flow. Just enjoy it and next time do not procrastinate.
