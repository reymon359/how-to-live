# Learn the difference between procrastination and leisure time.

Sometimes it is hard to differentiate whether we are spending leisure time or if we are procrastinating. This can make us feel bad because we can think we are procrastinating, and we will not enjoy that leisure time.

Suppressing leisure in hopes that you will get more done will not make you more productive. 

 When you avoid your need for leisure, you will lose control and instead of taking just a few minutes between tasks, you will find yourself browsing social media for hours.

You have to set time aside for leisure activities, even if you have a lot of work to do. If you work for too long you will soon become uninspired and uncritical.

Another way to tell if you are procrastinating resides inside you when you feel you are skipping some other important task you had planned to work on.
