# Learn the difference between procrastination and leisure time

Sometimes you can feel bad in your free time, thinking that you are procrastinating.

It may be hard to differentiate whether we are spending leisure time or if we are procrastinating. This can make us feel bad because we think we are procrastinating, and we don't enjoy that leisure time.

Suppressing leisure in hopes that you will get more done will not make you more productive. When you avoid your basic need for leisure, you may lose control and instead of taking just a few minutes between tasks, you will find yourself browsing social media for hours.

You have to set time aside for leisure activities, even if you have a lot of work to do. If you work for too long, it will become harder to focus.

Find a balance between work and leisure time to avoid procrastinating. Use planning and time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique.

In the end, it is hard to discern between both. Pay attention to how you feel at that time. You know inside yourself when you are procrastinating when you are doing so. You feel you shouldn't be wasting time on what you are doing or, in other words, avoiding what you should be doing.
