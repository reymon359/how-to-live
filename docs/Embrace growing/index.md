# Embrace growing

Life is about growing. Live things are the ones that grow.

As a fruit, growing means that you will get more mature. However, never leave the child inside yourself. Keep being curious and eager to do fun things. Be yourself.

Accomplish goals and objectives to grow, it will motivate you and make you happier.

Stepping out of the comfort zone will make you grow faster.

Not all of us grow at the same pace and in the same subjects. Don't worry and think other people are growing faster. Maybe you have grown more in different things than them. Be open-minded and respect other people at all time.

Growing is about getting to know yourself better. Spend time alone to accomplish it. However, remember that interacting with other people, getting to know new places and having new experiences will make you grow too. Try to find your balance between both.
