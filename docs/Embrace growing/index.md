# Embrace growing

Life is about growing. Live things are the ones able to grow.

Stepping out of your comfort zone will make you grow faster.

Be motivated to grow, learn and accomplish goals.

Not all of us grow at the same pace or the same subjects. Don't worry and think other people are growing faster. You may have grown more in different topics. Be open-minded and respect other people's pace of life.

Growing is also about getting to know yourself better. Spend time alone and interact with other people. Try to find your balance between both. 

Getting to know new places and having new experiences will make you grow, too.

While growing, never leave the child inside yourself. Keep being curious and eager to do fun things.
