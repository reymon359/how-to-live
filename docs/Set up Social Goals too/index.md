# Set up Social Goals too

Don't focus only in career goals.

Don't forget about family and friends.

Set up goals to improve social relationships with others. For example, with the ones you care and the ones you need to collaborate together.

Set up a reminder now and then to talk to the people you want to keep contact with.
