# Don't worry

When you worry about something you are just wasting your present time. I learned this on the chapter 5 "The Useless Emotions — Guilt and Worry" from Wayne Dyer's Your Erroneous Zones.

Here are some sentences from it, I added to my project [Book Sentences](https://github.com/reymon359/book-sentences/blob/master/books/your-erroneous-zones/README.md#5-the-useless-emotions--guilt-and-worry)

There is nothing to worry about! Absolutely nothing. You can spend the rest of your life, beginning right now, worrying about the future, and no amount of your worry will change a thing.

Worry is... ...being immobilized in the present as a result of things that are going or not going to happen in the future.

You must be careful not to confuse worrying with planning for the future. If you are planning, and the present-moment activity will contribute to a more effective future, then this is not worry. It is worry only when you are in any way immobilized now about a future happening.

Worry is endemic to our culture. Almost everyone spends an inordinate amount of present moments worrying about the future. And all of it is for naught.

Not one moment of worry will make things any better. In fact, worry will very likely help you to be less effective in dealing with the present.

**And here are some strategies for eliminating worry**

View your present moments as times to live, rather than to obsess about the future... ...When you catch yourself worrying, ask yourself, “What am I avoiding now by using up this moment with worry?” Then begin to attack whatever it is you’re avoiding

- Recognize the preposterousness of worrry... ...Ask yourself over and over, “Is there anything that will ever change as a result of my worrying about it?”
- Give yourself shorter and shorter periods of “worry-time.”... ...Use these periods to fret about every potential disaster you can get into the time slot. Then, using your ability to control your own thoughts, postpone any further worry until your next designated “worry-time.” You’ll soon see the folly of using any time in this wasteful fashion, and will eventually eliminate your worry zone completely.
- Make a worry list of everything you worried about yesterday, last week and even last year. See if any of your worry did anything productive for you... ...Worry is really a doubly wasteful activity. It does nothing to alter the future. And the projected catastrophe often turns out to be minor, or even a blessing when it arrives.
- _Just Worry!_ See if it is something that you can demonstrate when you are tempted to worry. That is, stop and turn to someone and say, “Watch me—I’m about to worry.” They’ll be confounded since you probably won’t even know how to demonstrate the thing you do so well, so often.
- Ask yourself... ...“What’s the worst thing that could happen to me (or them) and what is the likelihood of it occurring?” You’ll discover the absurdity of worry in this way.
- Deliberately choose to act in some manner that is in direct conflict with your usual areas of worry... ...If you compulsively save for the future... ...begin to use your money today. Be like the rich uncle who put in his will, “Being of sound mind, I spent all my money while I was alive.”
- Begin to face the fears you possess with productive thought and behavior... ...an effective challenge to a fear or worry is the most productive way to eradicate it from your life.
- The most effective weapon you have for wiping out worry is your own determination to banish this neurotic behavior from your life.

Try not to worry and learn to let things flow. Rather than worrying about what will happen, adapt to the situation when it happens.

Don't worry what people say or what people think. Be yourself.
