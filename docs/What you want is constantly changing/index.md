# What you want is constantly changing

It may sound pretty obvious, but sometimes it's hard to realize we are constantly changing and growing, and our interests change as we do so.

When you were younger, the movies you watched, the music you listened to, the kind of food you ate, or the people you hanged out with were probably different from now. And all of this is completely normal.

Even today, the things you want may not be the same as yesterday or tomorrow.

This situation sometimes causes it harder to make decisions. However, remember that no choice is wrong or right.

Try to assume it. Don't worry, and let things flow. Enjoy the moment you are right now and focus on the things you want at that moment. Focus on the present.
