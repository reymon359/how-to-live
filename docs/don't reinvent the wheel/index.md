# Don't reinvent the wheel

Check the _state of the art_ of that idea before deep diving into it.

The first thing you should do when you have an idea or are looking for a solution is research. Check if that idea or a similar one already exists.

Research and ask for help to see if there is already a solution for your issue.

You will save an enormous quantity of time and effort.
