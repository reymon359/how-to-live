# Don't be emotionally attached to money and material things

When money is your ideal, you won’t like spending it because it’s the thing you’re working for!  But when money is not your ultimate goal, you recognize that money is easily replaceable.  A dollar made today is the same as a dollar made tomorrow.

Material things come and go. If you get attached to them emotionally, you will suffer when they are no longer there.

The less attached emotionally to things you are, the happier you will be.

Follow a minimalism lifestyle. The fewer things you have, the fewer attachments.

## Quotes

> “You can’t substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship. Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness.” ― Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie

> “The territorialism and desire to possess things comes directly from the ego, which strives to own and control things. Your spirit already knows you own nothing. It is a matter of realizing that your happiness does not depend on your ownership of things. They help you in your journey but they are not the journey itself.” ― Karen Kingston

> Material things ain't nothing. You feel me? At the end of the day, it's who you is. You wasn't born with it; you gon' die without it. ― Nipsey Hussle
