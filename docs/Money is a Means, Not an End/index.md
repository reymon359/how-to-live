# Money is a Means, not an End

Money alone is worthless.

Think of money about something you use to accomplish other things. In other words, focus on the thing, not for the money. If you want to make a trip, focus on the trip, not on the money you will spend or how much things will cost. Create a budget, but don't spend all your time and effort thinking on it. In the end, the important is to enjoy the trip. To enjoy life.

Another example I found on this topic

Let’s say a relative passed away in another state and you are deciding if you can afford to fly out for the funeral on short notice. There are two different mindsets:

Money as a means: We can afford to go, even if it means hitting our savings target a month late.  We only get so many relatives, but we can always make more money.
Money as an end: We can’t afford to go because it would mean dipping into our savings.  We would love to go but it’s just not in the budget right now.

Money is a means that allows us to reach our end goals.  The reason you hear people say that money can’t buy happiness is because those people whose ideal was to have more and more money were disappointed.  Money in and of itself doesn’t bring you fulfillment.
