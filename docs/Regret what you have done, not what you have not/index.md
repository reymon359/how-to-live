# Regret what you have done, not what you have not

If you want to do something, just do it. If you can do something, and you don't, you may regret not having done it.

Don't worry or overthink about what will happen if you do it.

However, don't feel guilty about not having done something. Life is about choices, and there are no good or bad ones, they are just choices. Ones will bring you a kind of experiences and others different ones.

In the end, this one is about not getting old and having done nothing. If you have the chance to do something that you feel you will step outside your comfort zone, don't be afraid of doing it, or you may regret it in the future.
