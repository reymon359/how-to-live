# Regret what you have done, not what you have not

If you can and want to do something, and you don't, you may regret not having done it. Therefore, just do it. 

Don't worry or overthink about what will happen if you do it.

However, don't feel too much guilt about not having done something. Life is about choices, and there are no good or bad ones, they are just choices. Ones will bring you a kind of experiences and others different ones.

If you have the chance to do something that you feel will step outside your comfort zone, don't be afraid of doing it, or you may regret it in the future.

The goal is about not getting old and having done nothing. 

Don't be afraid to live. If you have the opportunity to go on a trip, chat with someone, parachute from an airplane, do it. Don't regret what you did not experience.
