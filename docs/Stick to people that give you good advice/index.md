# Stick to people that give you good advice

As time passes, you will realize the advice from some people has helped you more than others in the tough moments. That only with some people you can really count and grow.

Be grateful for having them. Stick to them, and try not to lose contact. Spend time with them and work on those relationships.

When you are in trouble, reach to them for help and listen to their opinion.

Be there for them, too. Offer your help to them whenever they need it.
