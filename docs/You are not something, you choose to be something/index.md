# You are not something, you choose to be something

Take the initiative and responsibility to change and improve the situation.

Avoid the "I am"s. For example, "I am lazy". You are not a lazy person, you chose to be lazy.

You are what you choose to be. If you eat healthily, you are a healthy person. If you regularly study, you are a studious person.

Take action and be proactive. Change all those behaviors that you don't like but keep doing because you think you _are_ in such a way and can not change.

There is a quote I love about this topic that states:

> “We are what we do to change what we are.” — Eduardo Galeano

## Quotes

> I’m poor at math, spelling, reading, languages, etc. This I’m guarantees that you won’t put in the effort required to change... ...As long as you label yourself inept, you have a built-in reason to avoid tackling it. — Wayne Dyer

> All self-defeating “I’ms” are the result of the use of these four neurotic sentences: (1)“That’s me.” (2) “I’ve always been that way.” (3) “I can’t help it.” (4)“That’s my nature.”...Every time you use one of these four sentences you are really saying, “And I intend to continue being the way I’ve always been.” — Wayne Dyer

> I’m Italian, German, Jewish, Irish, Black, Chinese, etc. These are your ethnic I’ms, and they work very well when you run out of other reasons to explain some behaviors that you have, which don’t work for you, but are just too damned difficult to tackle. — Wayne Dyer

> Only a ghost wallows around in his past, explaining himself with self- descriptors based on a life lived through. You are what you choose today, not what you’ve chosen before. — Wayne Dyer

> We are what we do to change what we are — Eduardo Galeano
