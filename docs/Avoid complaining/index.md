# Avoid complaining

To complain is a waste of time. If you don't like your situation, do something to change it. Adapt to it.

Just complaining won't make things better. When you complain, sometimes you are just looking for people’s attention by feeling pity and making others worry about you.

Self-love means accepting yourself as a worthy person because you choose to do so. Acceptance also means an absence of complaining.

One of the meanings of happiness it to not complain about the things you can do nothing about.

Complaining is the refuge of those who have no self-reliance.

Do not look for excuses in the face of difficulties to avoid the problem. Evading is not solving. Change your thought "it can't be done", to "How can I do it?".

To complain is to be reactive. Instead, be proactive.
