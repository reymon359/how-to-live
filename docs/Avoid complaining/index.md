# Avoid complaining

To complain is a waste of time. If you don't like something, do something to change that situation.

Just complaining won't make things better. When you complain, you look for people’s attention by feeling pity and making others worry about you.

Self-love means accepting yourself as a worthy person because you choose to do so. Acceptance also means an absence of complaint.

Fully functioning people never complain.

Happiness means no complaining about the things over which you can do nothing.

Complaining is the refuge of those who have no self-reliance.
