# Update others about your commitment

Communicate as much as you can to keep things clear. Keep others updated on the status of your commitment to avoid surprises and misunderstandings.

No matter if the commitment is going good or bad. It is better to be updated about a bad commitment than to find problems about it later.

Be punctual. If you commit to meet someone at a certain hour, update them if you won't be able to attend it.

Avoiding surprises will help you have fewer issues.

If you need help to complete a commitment, ask for it.

Keeping up your commitments is related to your honesty and integrity. It means you can be trusted.

## Quotes

> Commitment is about certainty. Other people are going to accept your commitments and make plans based upon them... ...Missing a commitment is an act of dishonesty only slightly less onerous than an overt lie. ― Robert C. Martin

> If you can’t make your commitment, the most important thing is to raise a red flag as soon as possible to whoever you committed to. ― Robert C. Martin

> Creating a language of commitment may sound a bit scary, but it can help solve many of the communication problems programmers face today—estimations, deadlines, and face-to-face communication mishaps. You’ll be taken as a serious developer who lives up to their word, and that’s one of the best things you can hope for in our industry. ― Robert C. Martin
