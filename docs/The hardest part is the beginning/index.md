# The hardest part is the beginning

There is a huge difference between planning and actually getting started with something.

Starting something means challenging the unknown and stepping outside our comfort zone, which is always hard.

Try to split a goal into smaller parts to help you begin with. Then go one by one, step by step.

Do not wait for motivation to do things. Take action, and the motivation will come. Many have the idea that you need to be motivated to get things done. It is true that being motivated helps, however, many times you have to keep moving despite the lack of it. Keep moving will help motivation to appear.
