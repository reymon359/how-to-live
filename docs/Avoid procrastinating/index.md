# Avoid procrastinating

Procrastinating is just postponing things you should be doing now for later.

If you want to accomplish something, you need to avoid doing it and focus on doing the things now.

It is sometimes hard to differentiate procrastinating from pleasure time. Do not avoid the second one, we need pleasure times to relax.

You are not necessarily what you say. Behavior is a much better barometer of what you are than words. What you do in your present moments is the only indicator of what you are as a person.

By identifying why you procrastinate, you can begin to hash out a plan to avoid this and increase your productivity.

> “Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.” ― Marthe Troly-Curtin

> “You may delay, but time will not, and lost time is never found again." ― Benjamin Franklin

## Resources and credits

Chapter 9: Putting An End to Procrastination — Now from Wayne Dyer's Your Erroneous Zones discusses this topic. Here is an extract from it:

> Three neurotic phrases of the procrastinator: “I hope things will work out.” “I wish things were better.” “Maybe it’ll be okay.”
> 
> There you have the deferrer’s delight. As long as you say maybe, or hope, or wish, you can use these as a rationale for not doing anything now.
> 
> All wishing and hoping are a waste of time—the folly of fairyland residents.
> 
> You can do anything that you set your mind to accomplish. You are strong, capable and not the least bit brittle. But by putting things off for a future moment, you are giving into escapism, self-doubt, and most significantly, self-delusion.
> 
> If you spend your time complaining about how much you have to do (procrastination), then you’ll have no present-moment time for doing it.
