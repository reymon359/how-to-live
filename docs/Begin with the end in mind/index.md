# Begin with the end in mind

Picture your ideal self, the type of person you would like to be. Once you have a clear idea about it, aim your life to reach it.

When you do something, think if it will contribute to the goals you want to accomplish,  to the person you want to be.

To begin with the end in mind is to visualize your life, career, or a specific project the way that you want it to end up being before you actually begin pursuing it. When you make this conscious effort, you take much greater control over your life and circumstances.

There is no need to have a clear idea of it. You never know how your life will change and probably what you want right now won't be the same later.

Do not just act; think first: Is this how I want it to go, and are these the correct consequences?

## Quotes

> To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction. â€“ Stephen R. Covey

> "Each one of us has to start out with developing his or her own definition of success. And when we have these specific expectations of ourselves, we're more likely to live up to them. Ultimately, it's not what you get or even what you give, it's what you become" - Mary Gates
