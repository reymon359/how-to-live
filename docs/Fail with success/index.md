# Fail with success

Each failure is an opportunity to learn from the mistakes made, leading to success. Society expects us not to fail, however, we have to fail to succeed.
 
If you fail at something, just get the best of it.
 
Apologize if you have to, look for solutions and ways to do it better, improve.
 
Mistakes happen. How you fight them is the key. Each mistake is a chance to learn something new. Think this way and success will follow.
 
Don't feel guilty and worry about failing.

Stepping outside your comfort zone is full of mistakes and learning. Don't be afraid of it.
 
Be responsible for what you have done, even if it was not intended. Have ownership of it and try to solve it.
