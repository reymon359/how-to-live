# Let it flow

This one is central when facing most problems in life. There are things that we can not control or predict, and it is not worth it to worry about them. Therefore, let things flow and adapt to them. Focus on the present.

Avoid overthinking or over plan things. Plan the minimum required and then let them flow. When the situation changes, adapt to it.

Let each one do what they want. Open your mind to other people's likes and opinions. Learn from others' behaviors and experiences.

The Lion King's "Hakuna Matata" is another way to express this.

When I was living in Morocco, the people there taught me a word called _Insha'Allah_ which means "if God wills" or "God willing".  My friends and I used it with the same meaning as saying _let it flow_.
