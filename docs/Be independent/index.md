# Be independent

Try to depend as little as possible on other people and things.

Your life will be easier, you will have less to worry about, less stress.

Personal independence boosts your confidence

Being independent makes decision making an easy task; this is because you have proven to yourself that you are the only person that will be really affected by the decisions you make.

You will be happier in the end.

To be more independent means being prepared and free to meet new people and try new things.

You will have more freedom.
