# Sing

A simple one. 

Sing. 

Just sing. 

Sing everywhere and whenever you want.

Singing makes you happy.

And dance too if you want. Move your body to the sound of the music.

Don't worry about what others will think. If you want to do it, just do it. 

Whistle too if you know how to. If not and you would like to, practice.

A lot of times I have left my house and headed to the street singing. You would be surprised by the number of people that end up singing along with me while passing.
