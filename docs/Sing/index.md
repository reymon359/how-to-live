# Sing

Sing. 

Just sing. 

Pay attention to how you feel when doing it, It should make you feel better and relaxed.

Try to whistle or hum the lyrics if you don't know them properly. Don't worry about what others will think. If it brings you joy, and you want to do it, just do it. 

And dance too if you want. Move your body to the sound of the music.
