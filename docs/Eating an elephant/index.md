# Eating an elephant

This is probably one of my favourites advice.

> How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!

There is no other way. The same applies with whatever you want to accomplish in life, you do it one step at a time. Little by little.

You don't have to worry. You have to plan and work on it constantly. If you want to get better at something you need to practice regularly

Remember there is no need to hurry, no matter how big the goal is, if you are constant and want to achieve you will do it. Enjoy the way to accomplish it.

Plan the steps and book time for them.
