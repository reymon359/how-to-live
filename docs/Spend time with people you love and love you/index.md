# Spend time with people you love and love you

Family, friends, loved ones. In the end, the time we spend with them is the most enjoyable.

Therefore, try to spend time with them. Book time for it.

The moments spent with them are the most valuable ones in the long term.

You will be happier when spending time with the people that you love and love you.

Take care of your relationship with them. Spend time physically or if not possible by calling each other in the distance. Whatever it takes to not lose contact.
