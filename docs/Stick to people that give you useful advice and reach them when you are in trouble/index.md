# Stick to people that give you useful advice and reach them when you are in trouble

The more you live, the more you realize that only certain people's advice really helps you in the tough moments. Only with some people you can really count and grow.

Be grateful for having them. Stick to them, and include them in your life. 

Spend time with them and work on those relationships.

When you are in trouble, remember them and reach them for help.

Be there for them, too. Offer your help to them whenever they need it.
