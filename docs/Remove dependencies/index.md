# Remove dependencies

Try not to be dependent on things or people. Every dependency on something makes it harder to accomplish something else.

In life, like in software development, the fewer dependencies you have the better.

Embrace minimalism, have as few material things as you can. As you are responsible for them, you may have to take care of them when you don't want to.

The more independence you have, the more freedom as well to make your own choices and do what you really want.

From time to time, look at your dependencies and remove the ones you no longer need.

## Quotes

> Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. ― Mitt Romney

> One of the most important of life´s lessons is to learn independance, to understand freedom. This means independence from attachments, from results, from opinions, and from expectations. Breaking attachments leads to freedom, but breaking attachments does not mean abandoning a loving and meaningful relationship, a relationship that nourrishes your soul. It means ending dependency on any person or thing. Love is never a dependency. ― Brian Weiss

> Don't be dependent. At all. Ever. Period. ― Jordan Peterson

> “For everyone you create to be dependent on you, you are equally dependent on them. Neither relationship is healthy.” ― Alan Cohen

> “People addicted with technology. Technology has indulged mankind. Beware of technology dependency!” ― Toba Beta

> It's not dependency that creates your future. It's independence that creates your better future. ― Jim Rohn

## Resources and credits

I got better at this doing software development and reading books like The Pragmatic Programmer from Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas and The Clean Coder, or The Clean Architecture from Robert C. Martin
