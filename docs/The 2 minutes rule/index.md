# The 2 minutes rule

This rule is pretty easy, basically:

"If something takes you less than two minutes, then do it now"

If it takes more time, postpone it. Add it to a to-do list for another moment. Set up reminders for doing it in the future.

Think if you are truly responsible for doing it and if not, delegate it.

It's a great tip to stop procrastinating and getting things done.

You can also split big tasks into smaller ones that take you about two minutes to complete to get started with the big ones.

## Quotes

> “Use 2-minute rule. The two-minute rule says that when a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later. It really helps to deal with small things quicker and lets your brain to be much less occupied.” — Roman Tsegelskyi

## Resources and credits

As far as I know, this originally comes from David Allen’s book, Getting Things Done.

I think I learned this one from David Roncero or at least he mentioned it to me at some point.

In the Atomic Habits book from James Clear talked about it, although he focuses more on creating small habits rather than completing small tasks.
