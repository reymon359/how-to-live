# The 2 minutes rule

This is a simple and useful rule to boost your productivity and task management. It states:

“If something takes you less than two minutes, then do it now”

If it takes more time, postpone it. Add it to a to-do list for another moment. Set up reminders for doing it in the future.

Try to split big tasks into smaller ones that will take you about two minutes to complete to get started with the big ones.

Think if you are the one responsible for doing it and if not, delegate it.

Try to follow this simple rule to stop procrastinating and getting things done.

> “Use 2-minute rule. The two-minute rule says that when a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later. It really helps to deal with small things quicker and lets your brain to be much less occupied.” — Roman Tsegelskyi

## Resources and credits

As far as I know, this rule originally comes from David Allen’s book, Getting Things Done.

However, I learned this one from David Roncero, or at least he mentioned it to me at some point.

In the Atomic Habits book by James Clear, he discussed it. Although, he focuses more on creating small habits rather than completing small tasks.
