# The simpler the better

When you are facing a problem, look for the simplest solution for it.

There will be more than one, however, focus on the easiest to implement.

Minimalism comes along simplicity. Embrace minimalism and focus on having the least dependencies. This will lead to fewer problems.

This one is inspired from the Occam's razor the principle, or the principle of parsimony which states that "entities should not be multiplied without necessity", sometimes inaccurately paraphrased as "the simplest explanation is usually the best one."

It is also related to the Software Development principle KISS — Keep It Simple Stupid.
