# Ask for forgiveness, not permission

Sometimes is better to take the initiative and do something instead of wait for permission.

Remember to be kind and don't move forward if what you are going to do will harm others.

If what you did was not well seen or did't ended well, apologize and try to amend it.

Be proactive. It's not about doing things that are illegal or immoral. It is about not waiting for anyone else's approval to get things done.
