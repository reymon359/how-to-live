# Avoid overthinking

To overthink is to think about something more than necessary. It is a waste of time and energy. It immobilizes you.

When we overthink too much about doing something, or we plan it without taking action, we are suffering _Analysis Paralysis._

Sometimes we overthink about what doesn't depend on us. If you need to, ask for help. Communicate with the people those things depend on to solve them.
