# Life has its own stages

You are not the same person as yesterday. And you can not expect to be the same as you were in the past or will be in the future. The things you do and like when you are 15 are not the same when you are 30. There are life stages and as we grow we pass through them.

Do not expect people to do or like the same things as you just because you have a similar age. Everyone has their own stages and move at a different pace. Be open-minded about it and respect them.

Learn from them. Try to get the best of what they do. Respectfully, share and provide them with your experience and advice on them.

## Quotes

> “A butterfly does not return to a caterpillar after it is mature. We must learn to grow and evolve into a stronger, wiser and better version of ourselves. Life occurs in stages and taking a step at a time is key to learning and growing.” ― Kemi Sogunle

> We all have different narratives; all of our narratives are at different stages of development. ― Viola Davis

> “No age of life is inglorious. Youth has its merits, but living to a ripe old age is the true statement of value. Aging is the road that we take to discern our character. Fame and fortune can elude us, but character is immortal. We must encounter a sufficient variety of experiences including both failures and accomplishments in order to gain nobility of character.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster,

> “Every stage of life is unique. At any age and stage of life there are obstacles and opportunities, trials and triumphs. Never allow the negative bring to you to sudden halt. Make the most of the positive opportunities and stay positive.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita

A deep chat with a good friend (Pablo Llorca) made me realize about this.
