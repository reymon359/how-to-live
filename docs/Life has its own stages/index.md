# Life has its own stages

You can not expect to always be the same as you were in the past.
The things you do and like when you are a teenager are not the same when you are in your thirties. You are not even the same person as yesterday. There are life stages and as we grow we pass through them.

Do not expect people to do or like the same things as you just because you have a similar age. Everyone has their own stages and move at a different pace. Be open-minded about it and respect them.

Learn from others. Try to get the best of how they are doing. Communicate, share experiences and advice to learn from them.

No matter the stage you are at, enjoy it. Try to focus on doing what brings you joy.

## Quotes

> “A butterfly does not return to a caterpillar after it is mature. We must learn to grow and evolve into a stronger, wiser and better version of ourselves. Life occurs in stages and taking a step at a time is key to learning and growing.” ― Kemi Sogunle

> We all have different narratives; all of our narratives are at different stages of development. ― Viola Davis

> “No age of life is inglorious. Youth has its merits, but living to a ripe old age is the true statement of value. Aging is the road that we take to discern our character. Fame and fortune can elude us, but character is immortal. We must encounter a sufficient variety of experiences including both failures and accomplishments in order to gain nobility of character.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster,

> “Every stage of life is unique. At any age and stage of life there are obstacles and opportunities, trials and triumphs. Never allow the negative bring to you to sudden halt. Make the most of the positive opportunities and stay positive.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita
