# Avoid overengineering

Overengineering is the act of designing a product to be more robust or have more features than often necessary for its intended use, or for a process to be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.

When you overengineer, you may end up with unwanted dependencies.

It is related to going for the best solution in the long term to your problem.

It is similar to the Occam’s Razor statement that “The simplest solution is always the best”. Look for the simplest solution for the moment. However, don't rush for the first solution you come up with, spend some time thinking which one will work better in the long term.

## Resources and acknowledgments

I learned this doing Software Development and on books like The Clean Architecture from Robert C. Martin. Here are some sentences from it:

> When faced with a framework, try not to marry it right away. See if there aren’t ways to date it for a while before you take the plunge.
>
> Keep the framework behind an architectural boundary if at all possible, for as long as possible.
>
> Avoid overengineering.
