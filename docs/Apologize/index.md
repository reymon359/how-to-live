# Apologize

Apologize means _to express regret for something that one has done wrong._

Apologizing is always the right thing to do if you did something wrong.

Although it may not solve the problem, it will help to solve it.

You will feel **better** after it.

**It’s never too late,** so if you want to apologize, you can. Therefore, just do it.

**Be honest** when you are apologizing, tell the truth of why you are sorry.

It can happen that the other person doesn't want to forgive you. It's ok, **respect their choice.** You did the right thing and that is important.

It can be hard if you are not used to. It's ok, just begin with an "I'm sorry" and let yourself go. Practice it, the more times you do it, the better you will get at it.
