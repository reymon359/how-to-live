## Quotes
Orson Welles'  "We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone."

Its important to include the next part of the quote:

Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone

Like any quote, the interpretation is ultimately up to the reader, i would suggest in this case, Orson was illustrating that ultimately, we are truly alone in this universe, from the moment we are born, to the moment we die. We view and experience the world through our own eyes, and we are only privy to our own thoughts and experiences.

People can share their thoughts and experiences with others, but ultimately, you can only understand them vicariously, through your own eyes, as it were, we can not TRULY understand what its like to live as someone else.

But, through love and friendship, socializing with others, we are capable of creating a momentary illusion that we are not alone, but that is all it is: an illusion, because at the end of the day, you are still stuck within your own mind and see the world through your eyes.

DAte yourself, miriam
