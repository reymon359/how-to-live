# Look for feedback

Learning from feedback is one of the best ways to grow. Look and ask for it.

Treat feedback as a gift. Both, when you get it and when you give it.

It is not normal for the feedback to come by itself. Ask for it. Tell to your closer ones that you want to hear what they think about you (good and bad) to improve.

Be grateful with the negative feedback. Don't be afraid of it. Embrace it because it is the one from you can improve the most.
