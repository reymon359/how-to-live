# Don't feel guilty

Remember this: No amount of guilt can ever undo anything.

When you feel guilt, you are immobilized in the present about something that has already happened. This degree of immobilization can run from mild upset to severe depression.

Learn from the past and try to avoid the mistakes you made and can't change, no matter how guilty you feel. Instead of feeling guilty about something you have already done, resolve not to behave in that way again.

Learn to forgive others and yourself.

Whatever choice you made was not good or better than others. There is no black or white. The choice you made brought you to a different path, that's all. Don't feel guilty about it.
