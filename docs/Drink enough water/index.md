# Drink enough water

This one sounds simple, however not drinking enough water can cause a lot of illness and issues.

Is just about taking care of yourself and your body.

Try to have always some water near you.

Always listening to your body when you are thirsty and drink.

Try to drink more water than other not-so-healthy drinks.
