# Learn to adapt

Life is continuously changing. Our environment, the people we interact with, even ourselves.

This change is good to keep growing. Embrace it and adapt to it. Don't try to force things to remain the same.

Be grateful for the change and for being able to adapt to it.

When you adapt to the change, you are being proactive.

Technology changes too, in fact, it does faster than most things. Avoid complaining when is hard to change along with it. Adapt to it.

Adapt to the moment. Sometimes things change suddenly, much faster than expected. For example, an outside plan gets ruined because of the weather. Adapt to it and look for an alternative plan, make the best of it, and look for solutions.
