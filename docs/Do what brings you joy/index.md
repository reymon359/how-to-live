# Do what brings you joy

When you are not sure if you are going in the right direction in life or worried about your future, focus on what brings you joy.

Pay attention to the things you are doing in your day by day and embrace those that bring you joy.

We tend to think too much about the future and where we want to be, sometimes it is better to focus on the present moment and the things that make us happy.

Maybe you have to step outside your comfort zone and change some aspects of your life to do what you want and bring you joy.
