# Find balance

Moderation and balance is the key point to enjoy life.

In almost every topic you find you have to balance it. For example, doing exercise: You have to do it in order to be healthy. However, you have to moderate the way you do so. You should not exercise too much that will hurt you, neither don't exercise at all. You have to find the balance between both that better suits your needs.

The more you know yourself, the easier to find the balance in things you need.
