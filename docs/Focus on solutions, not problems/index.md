# Focus on solutions, not problems

When you have a problem in life, don't get blocked by it. Avoid complaining about it and looking for someone to blame, look for a solution.

If you are the one that created the problem, don't feel guilty or worry about it. Feeling guilty or worrying about it won't solve it. Just look for a solution and learn from it.

When you focus on a solution, you are being proactive. You are taking action instead of waiting for the problem to be solved by itself.
