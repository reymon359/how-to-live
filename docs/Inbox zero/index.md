# Inbox zero

This one is about avoiding distractions and avoiding postponing duties for later.

It doesn't relate to just keeping your mail inbox clean. It relates also to answering other conversations on other platforms and finishing your to-dos.

Avoid having too many notifications. Have the minimum ones to get things done. Don't worry, if something important happens you will end up getting notified sooner or later by other means.

Following these steps, you will increase your productivity and will be less distracted from your goals.

## Resources

Although there is a book with the same title, I haven't read it. Therefore, I don't know how good it is as a resource.
