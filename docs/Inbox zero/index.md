# Inbox zero

Avoid distractions and postponing duties for later.

It doesn't relate to just keeping your mail inbox clean. It relates to finishing any to-dos. If you have something to do, do it, don't postpone it.

Avoid having too many notifications. Have the minimum ones to get things done. If something important happens, you will end up being notified sooner or later in other ways.
