# You shouldn't avoid communication

We, as humans, need to communicate with each other to understand ourselves.

You should not avoid these situations, the opposite, you should embrace them.

Communicating and, especially, listening, is the best way to understand something or someone.

If you find yourself in doubt about whether to start a conversation with someone unknown, think that it is only going to bring you positive things. Think about everything that person knows, and you can learn from them.

The more you communicate, the more knowledge is shared and the more you will learn about an issue.

If you have a problem and need help, ask for it, communicate.

When communicating, keep an open mind and respect what the other is telling you.
