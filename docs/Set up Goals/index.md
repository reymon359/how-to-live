# Set up goals

Think about your future. Think about what you want to achieve in life, where you want to be, who you want to be. Then set up goals to reach it.

Split those goals into smaller ones to measure them better. Then plan how to accomplish the smaller ones. Book time for them.

Don't be afraid of big goals. You will reach them if you are constant. Little by little.

It is hard to think about the future. To plan for the unknown. Therefore, some long-term goals may not be clear. However, it is better to have an idea of them than not having goals at all.

Set up reminders. If you really want to accomplish something for the long term, try to remind yourself to do so.
