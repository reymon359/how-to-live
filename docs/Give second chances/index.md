# Give second chances

Giving a second chance means to forgive.
 
Not just to people, but to ideas, trips, places, foods, ... everything.
 
Maybe the first time you are trying something, at that moment you don't like it, or it doesn't work as you planned. However, who knows, a lot of things can change the second time you try it, and it may end up being a success.
 
Be careful with third, fourth and more chances.
 
If you get a second chance for something, do not waste it.
