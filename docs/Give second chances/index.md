# Give second chances
 
Give second chances not just to people, but to ideas, trips, places, foods, … anything.
 
Maybe the first time you try something, you don't like it, or it doesn't work as you planned. However, a lot of things can change the second time you try it, and it may end up being a success.
 
Be careful when you give third, fourth, and more chances. If something doesn't work after a certain number of chances, the probability of working gets smaller.
 
And in the other way around, If you get a second chance at something, try not to waste it.

When you forgive someone, in some way, you are giving them a second chance.
