# Go to the doctor

From time to time we get ill. It just happens. If you feel bad, don't wait things to get worse. Go to the doctor and ask for help.

Take care of your body and listen to it.

If you avoid going to the doctor, sometimes it can be too late.

Tell the truth to the doctor, don't feel embarrassed or afraid of your symptoms. They just want to help you and make you feel better.
