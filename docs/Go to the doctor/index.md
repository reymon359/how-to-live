# Go to the doctor

From time to time we get ill. It happens. If you feel bad, don't wait for things to get worse. Go to the doctor and ask for help.

Take care of your body and listen to it.

If you avoid going to the doctor, things can get worse, and may even not have a solution.

Tell the truth to the doctor, don't feel embarrassed or afraid of your symptoms. They just want to help you and make you feel better. The more information you give to them, the better they will diagnose you.

By default, the healthier your life is, the fewer times you will have to go to the doctor.
