# Be empathetic

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person within their frame of reference. The capacity to place oneself in another's position.

When you are empathetic toward others, you help them feel better about themselves.

It's a better way to understand other people's problems and help them solve them.

Everyone has their own problems, be open-minded when someone tells you their issues. Don't judge them.

Show care and concern. Try to understand how they may be feeling. Be kind to them.

The more you understand someone and the issues they have, the better you can help them.

To understand others better, listen to them empathically.

## Quotes

> “We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know.” ―  Carl Rogers

> “All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.” ― Tahereh Mafi

> “The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen.” ― Elisabeth Kübler-Ross

> “Empathy is simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment, emotionally connecting, and communicating that incredibly healing message of you’re not alone.” – Brene Brown
