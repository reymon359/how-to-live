# Be empathetic

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person.

When you are empathetic toward others, you help them feel better about themselves.

It's a better way to understand other people's problems and help them solve them.

Everyone has their own problems, be open-minded when someone tells you their issues. Don't judge them.

Show care and concern. Try to understand how they may be feeling. Be kind to them.
