# Book leisure time

// TODO improve

Book time to do activities or just relax etc

Also let things flow and adapt to situations when some leisure plans appear you really want to do and had not plan them. If you wan't to do it just do it. you can recover that time to work in the future but the opportunity of that activity will not be repeated.
