# Don't judge the whole by the part

You cannot judge a group by one person from it.

The same goes by judging a person just for being part of a country, group, community, ... All of us are different and have different opinions and beliefs.

This also goes with other things, just because you have visited a city from a country you can not judge the whole country. Or just because you tried a local food you didn't like from a country you can not say you dislike the whole country's food.
