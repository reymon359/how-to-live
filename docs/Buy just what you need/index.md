# Buy just what you need

When you are going to buy something, ask yourself if you really need it and if you will still need them in the long term. 

Maybe you already have something similar that fulfills that function.

You can postpone buying it for a week or a month and find out if you still need it.

Find the balance between something you need and something that makes you happy. If something makes you happy, really happy, not just a bit better at the moment, then go ahead. For example, when you want to buy a sweet or ice cream just because trying it makes you happy.
