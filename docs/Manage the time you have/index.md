# Manage the time you have

Time is the only resource finite we have. It is probably the most valuable one. Take advantage of it, managing it properly. Some priorities and benefits would be:

- Setting priorities and goals.
- Spending the time more consciously.
- Reduce the time spent on non-priorities.
- Working on an environment more productive and effective.

Manage the time you spend in different categories such us work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments to give some examples. However, if there is a category you want or need to spend time to add it.

There are plenty of tools to do help us manage time more efficiently, like the "Pomodoro Technique".

Spend time planning your time, forgive the redundancy. Book a bit of time each day to plan the next day, and a bit of time each week to plan the next one.
