# Listen to music

Music is one of the gifts from life. Be grateful for it.

Fill your life with music. Most life moments, like a road trip or a party, can be improved with the proper music. Some genres are more appropriate at some occasions. 

Sometimes the best music is the silence itself. The sound that surrounds you. Enjoy it too.

Be open-minded about music. Try to listen to new music from time to time; new artists, new genres, new songs. You may discover and enjoy the new sounds.

Don't just listen, sing and dance too. Enjoy music in its fullness.
