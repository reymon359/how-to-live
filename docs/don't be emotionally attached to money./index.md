# Don't be emotionally attached to money

When money is your ideal, of course you won’t like spending it — it’s the thing you’re working for!  But when money is not your ultimate goal, you recognize that money is easily replaceable.  A dollar I make today is the same as a dollar I make tomorrow.

To illustrate, here is another example.  Let’s say a relative passed away in another state and you are deciding if you can afford to fly out for the funeral on short notice.  There are two different mindsets:

Money as a means: We can afford to go, even if it means hitting our savings target a month late.  We only get so many relatives, but we can always make more money.
Money as an end: We can’t afford to go because it would mean dipping into our savings.  We would love to go but it’s just not in the budget right now.
