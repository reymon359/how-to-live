# Exercise frequently
 
Your body is your only way to communicate with the world. Take care of it to enjoy life fully.
 
Exercise regularly and keep your body fit.
 
Eat healthily and drink enough water to be healthy and have the energy to exercise properly.
 
Don't exercise too much. Don't force yourself. Listen to your body, and stop if you need it.
 
Enjoy the moments of exercise and see how you release stress. Exercising can help you clear your mind.
 
You may dislike to exercise alone, then try to do it in the company of others.
 
Maybe you don't like exercises like running. Try different sports or activities to find the one that suits you better.

You don't need to practice a sport, things like going for a walk are valid too.
