# Be punctual

The most important concept here is that when you agree to meet someone at a certain time you are making a promise.

If you are not in time is like lying to the other person. You were not honest.

Being unpunctual goes against your integrity.

If you are waiting for someone, try to enjoy the moment rather than getting upset or worrying. Enjoy where you are, think or plan something for later, take advantage of that time.

Saying I am unpunctual is not an excuse, neither the solution. You are not unpunctual, you choose to be unpunctual. Be proactive and responsible to change this.

If you are not going to make it on time, update the other person about it to avoid surprises.
