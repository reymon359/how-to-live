# Travel as much as you can

Few things will help you to open your mind, grow and learn in a way like traveling. If you have any opportunity to do it, go for it. You may regret not have done it.

When you arrive at a new place you will be exploring a new culture, music, gastronomy,... everything will be new.

Try to understand them. Look for the reason things are different. Research their history and ask questions. 

The more distant or different the place you visit, the better.

When you travel, respect the culture you are visiting. Be open-minded and respect the opinions and beliefs of others.

Have a look at new religions or habits and get the best of them.

Traveling is a great moment to try new things and will help you to understand yourself.

If you can, live there for some time instead of just visiting. In my opinion, living in a different place is the best way to get to know that place.

When you travel, let things flow. Plan the trip to the minimum and be open to modifying your plans with new experiences and opportunities that may appear.

Be ready to step outside your comfort zone when traveling.
