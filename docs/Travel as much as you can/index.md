# Travel as much as you can

travel, see other cultures, other food, people,

open your mind

Try new things when you travel

respect and get used to the culture

if you can, live there for some time. Living in a different place is the best way to get to know that place.

When you travel plan it, not that much but have an idea of  things you want to do or see
