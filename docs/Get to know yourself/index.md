# Get to know yourself

This one is special. Don't expect to achieve it easily. It will take your time.

Try not to follow what everyone does, this way it will be harder to get to know yourself. Do what brings you joy.

It includes getting to know which how do you feel in certain situations, which are your most productive moments, what makes you feel good, what you want to achieve, etc. The list is almost endless.

All you learn about yourself, respect it. Be kind to whom you truly are.

What other people think doesn't matter, you don't need their approval. Being yourself is way more important.

One of the best ways to get to know yourself is by spending time alone. Book time for yourself. Spend time doing what you truly want to do.

Try situations that put you outside the comfort zone. Travel to unknown countries. Having a look at how you act in new situations will help you get to know yourself better.
