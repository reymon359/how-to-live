# Get to know yourself

This one is a tough one. Therefore, don't expect to achieve it in an easy way. It will take a lot of time.

It includes to get to know which are your most productives moments, what make you feel good, what do you want to achieve, etc. It is almost endless.

All you learn about yourself, respect it. Be kind to who you trully are.

Don't follow what everyone does, this way it will be harder to get to know yourself.

Dont matter what other people think, being yourself is way more important. You don't need their approval.

One of the best ways to get to know yourself is to spend time alone. Book time for yourself, leisure time for your things.
