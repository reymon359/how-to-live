# Do what you want

If you really want to do something, just do it.

Other people may tell you that they wouldn't do it.

Do what you want while respecting others and doing no harm to anyone.

If you are happy doing something, that's what matters.

The more you know yourself, the easier it is to know what you really want.

Be open-minded and understand that other people also want to do what they want. No matter how different it is from what you want.

Pay attention to frustration, if you feel frustrated it may mean you are in a situation you do not want to be, or you may be doing something you don't want to do. Use that frustration, learn from it, and move toward the situation you want to be in.
