# Optimize your stuff

Optimizing your stuff means that what you have is what you need. No extra stuff or unnecessary items.

If you have 2 items that accomplish the same purpose, get rid of one of them.

Don't buy more things than the ones you need.

Check the things you own from time to time and get rid of whatever you no longer need.

Don't only focus on things, but on goals, habits, work, etc.

## Quotes

> We are all tasked to balance and optimize ourselves. - Mae Jemison

> Engineers love to optimize problems. Now I optimize logistical problems. I ask: 'What's the goal? What are our constraints? What is the optimal, elegant way to get to that goal within those constraints?' I break it down in terms of a data funnel: 'Where in the funnel are we inefficient?' That analytical background really helps. - Ruchi Sanghvi
