# Do no harm

Just be kind, try to help them instead of doing harm. 

Not just physically, but mentally too.

If you end up doing something harmful to another person, apologize and help them solve it.

We all make mistakes, and sometimes we can end up doing something we didn't intend to. Feeling worried or guilty won't solve it. Just apologize and help them.

Don't harm nature, either. Respect the world we all live on.
