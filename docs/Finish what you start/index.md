# Finish what you start

If you start something, try to finish it. Avoid leaving unfinished things.
 
When what you want to do is too big, split it into smaller goals to accomplish it.
 
When you don't finish the things you start, It's harder to get motivation and the feeling of accomplishment that leads you to make other things.
 
If you are about to finish something, it is the last effort you have to make, so don't give up!
 
To finish long-term things, you need to work on them constantly. Don't give up, and plan time to work on them. Set up reminders.
