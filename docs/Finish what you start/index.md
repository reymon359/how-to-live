# Finish what you start

If you start something, finish it.
 
When what you want to do is too big, split it into smaller goals to accomplish it.
 
When you don't finish the things you start, you never get motivation and the feeling of accomplishment that leads you to make other things.
 
This is more important if you are about to finish something. It is the last effort you have to make, so don't give up!
 
To finish things, you need to work on them constantly. Don't give things up. Plan time to work on them. Set up reminders.
