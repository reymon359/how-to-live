# Read books

Spend time reading books.

Book time for it. Try to read a bit each day or week.

You will learn much more from a book than from an article.

Any kind of book is good. Just start reading. Begin with one and explore new genres.

You will get better at reading with time and practice.

Pay attention to what you are reading. Avoid distractions while reading.

## Resources and credits

The more books I read, the more I like it. I feel that reading books make you think differently.

The act of reading is awesome, if you think about it, you are traveling to other dimensions and living new lives by just watching letters next to each other.
