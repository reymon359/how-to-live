# Relativize, don't generalize

Try not to generalize. Don't put everything and everyone in the same box.

To relativize is to have an open mind and understand that everything is different and related to some given circumstances.

Always, like never, doesn't exist. 

Respect others and give second chances instead of ending up generalizing.
