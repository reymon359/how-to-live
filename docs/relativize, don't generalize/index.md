# Relativize, don't generalize

Always, like never, doesn't exist. 

Do not generalize. Don't put everything and everyone in the same box.

To relativize is to have an open mind and understand that everything is different and related to some given circumstances.

Respect others and give second chances before you end up generalizing.
