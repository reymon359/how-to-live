# Respect others beliefs

We all live in the same world, but have been born in different places with different religions and cultures.

Respect their beliefs. Open your mind and try to understand them.

Most people believe in what they have been taught to believe, others just believe in what they need to. And some don't believe at all. The point is that you can not expect other people to believe in the same things as you.

Travel to experience other religions in a deeper way. You may not agree with the practices of other people based on their religion, however, you should respect them.

Do no harm. No matter what you believe, Do no harm.
