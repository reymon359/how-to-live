# Choose your problems

We all have different problems in life, and we need to find a way to solve them.

However, most of the problems we face can be chosen by ourselves.

For example, you can choose the problem to not enjoy smoking instead of the problem of having cancer in the future.

Sometimes making an extra effort can be a problem, however, it will prevent future ones.

Before committing to something, think about the problems related to it and if you will be able to bear them.
