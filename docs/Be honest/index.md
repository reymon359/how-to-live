# Be honest

Always go with the truth.

If you communicate with someone, don't lie to them.

By saying the truth, most of the problems won’t appear or will be solved earlier.

No matter how bad is the truth, it is always better than having the other person finding out that you were lying to them.

Being honest is related to keeping up with your integrity.

When you are honest with someone, you build trust with them.

Good relationships are built on top of honesty.
