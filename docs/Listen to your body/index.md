# Listen to your body

Our bodies give us signals to take care of it. For example, if you feel hungry, eat and if you feel tired, rest.

If you feel sick, take care of yourself and go to a doctor.

Your mind is part of your body, therefore listen to it too. If doing something gives you headaches or makes you feel bad, stop doing it.

> Your body is your best guide. It constantly tells you, in the form of pain or sensations, what's working for you and what's not. - Hina Hashmi

> I'm not dieting anymore. I want to eat what my body is asking of me. Just listen to your body in general - it's all self-awareness. - Mary Lambert
