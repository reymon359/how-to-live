# Listen to your body

Our bodies have evolved to give us signals to take care of it. If you are hungry, eat. If you are tired, rest. And the opposite, for example if you are no longer hungry don't keep eating.

If you feel sick, take care of yourself and go to a doctor.

Your mind is part of your body, therefore listen to it too.

> Your body is your best guide. It constantly tells you, in the form of pain or sensations, what's working for you and what's not. - Hina Hashmi

> I'm not dieting anymore. I want to eat what my body is asking of me. Just listen to your body in general - it's all self-awareness. - Mary Lambert
