# Say thank you to everything

TODO: Pass translator again here

Every time someone does something for you, give thanks for it.

Even the smallest thing they do for you.

Even when there seems to be nothing to give thanks for, just do it.

Just say it: thank you.

When someone is being grateful with you, thank them back.

You are being grateful back.
