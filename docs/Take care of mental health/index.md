# Take care of mental health

Be aware of mental health issues. Take care of yourself and other people when they're suffering them.

Take care of your body and your mind. Listen to it.

Don't do things that can make you feel worse afterward.

If you are having mental problems, ask for help. Go to the doctor.

Mental health is no joke. Offer your help to those that are struggling with it.
