# Put your phone down

![Put the phone down](./assets/live_the_moment_leave_the_phone.jpeg)

When you are _doing something_, but you are paying attention to your phone, you are not doing it fully.

When you are in a social moment like eating with friends or family, pay attention to the moment and don't be on the phone. If you decide to watch a movie, watch it, enjoy it, pay attention to the movie and the moment.

Don't be looking at the phone all the time.

If you are at a festival, don't be recording the whole performance. Make a small video or photo for the memories and keep the phone. Pay attention to it rather than wasting time on the phone.
