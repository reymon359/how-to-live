# Find a way to get the milk without buying the cow

This is not related to the topic of men who don't want to get married, when they can get all the benefits of marriage without getting married.

It is related to going for the best solution in the long term to your problem.

It is similar to the Occam’s Razor statement that "The simplest solution is always the best". However, this one focus not in the simplest but the best solution over time.

Don't rush for the first solution you come up with, spend some time looking for another one that will work better in the long term.

## Resources and credits

I learned it on The Clean Architecture from Robert C. Martin. Here it was related to working with frameworks.

> When faced with a framework, try not to marry it right away. See if there aren’t ways to date it for a while before you take the plunge.

> Keep the framework behind an architectural boundary if at all possible, for as long as possible.
