# Greetings before a Conversation

Always begin a conversation greeting the participants.
 
If you don't know what to say, a simple "hello, how are you?" is good enough.
 
This way, the other person will see some respect and interest from your side and will interact in a better way with you.
 
When you are greeting someone, you are showing some respect.
 
When you ask about how the other feels, listen emphatically to them. Understand how they really feel.
