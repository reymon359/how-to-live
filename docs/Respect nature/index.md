# Respect nature

Nature is simply amazing. We all live and share the same world. Let's respect this beauty we all share.

Respect the animals, plants, lakes, â€¦anything.

Keep it clean. When going to nature don't leave trash, and if you see trash try to pick it up.

Practice the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

- Reduce the things you buy.
- Reuse everything as much as you can.
- Recycle the trash.

Enjoy it. Take pleasure in hiking, watching plants, petting animals, and listening to all its sounds.
