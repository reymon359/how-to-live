# Respect others opinion

You should respect other people's opinions, even if you don't agree with them.

Nobody will agree with you about everything. We all live in different cultures with different situations.

Be open-minded when finding other people's opinions. Pay attention to understand them. Be emphatic when listening to them.

When there are different opinions about an issue, look for a win-win. Try to reach an agreement. If it is not possible, agree to disagree and keep respecting their opinion.
