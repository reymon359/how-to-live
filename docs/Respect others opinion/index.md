# Respect others opinion

Nobody thinks as you do. We all live in different cultures, social situations, experiences, etc.

You have to respect other people's opinions about something, even if you don't agree with it.

Be open-minded to what other people think about things. Listen and pay attention to understand them. Try to learn from it and grow. Be emphatic when listening to them.

When you have different opinions about an issue, look for a win-win. Try to reach an agreement for both, and if not possible, remember to keep respecting their opinion.
