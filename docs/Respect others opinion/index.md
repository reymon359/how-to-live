# Respect others opinion

Nobody thinks like you do, because of culture, social situations, experiences, whatever.

You have to respect other people opinion about something even if you don't agree with it

Be open minded to what other people think about things, you will learn a lot.

If you need to reach an agreement try to find a solution or if not just respect 

look for a win win
