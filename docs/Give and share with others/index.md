# Give and share with others

Yes. Sharing is caring. Be grateful for what you have. Share it with others that don't have it. It will make you both happier.

If you have something you no longer need or use, give it to other people that may need it.

Sharing, in the end, is helping, which makes you happier.

Don't give and share just material things, you can share knowledge, advice, support, time, etc.
