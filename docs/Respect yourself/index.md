# Respect yourself

To respect others properly, we first have to respect ourselves.

Respect all of you: Your feelings, what you really want, what you like, how you look, etc.

Respect your body. Take care of it eating healthy, exercising, and not taking harmful substances. 

If you don't love yourself, you will hardly love and respect others.

The better you know yourself, the easier it will be to respect yourself.
