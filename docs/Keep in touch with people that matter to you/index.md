# Keep in touch with people that matter to you

As humans, we tend and need to socialize. We feel the urge to communicate with other people. 

Of all the people we interact with, some of them are more connected to us. The ones we have a closer relationship with are the most important.

Don't forget to keep in touch with them. Keep the contact in the distance, even if you can not see each other.

Set a reminder to contact them from time to time if you need to.
