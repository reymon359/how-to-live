# Don't bad-mouth

Don't talk bad of people at their back. Actually, don't talk bad about others at all. Talking bad about someone is like complaining, and you should avoid it. Complaining is a waste of time.

Moreover, there is no need to. If you need to say something about someone, say it directly to them. Avoid having problems and reach an agreement or solution by communicating.

Bad-mouthing others goes against your integrity.

You are hurting others and yourself doing it. You will ruin relationships.

Others will trust you less when they see you doing it.

It will bring you more problems than solutions.
