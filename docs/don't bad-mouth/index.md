<br># Don't bad-mouth

Don't talk bad of people at their back.

Most of the times it will be to complain about others and any kind of complaining is a waste of time.

There is no need to. If you need to say something about someone say it in person. You will avoid having problems and reach an agreement or solution by communicating.

Bad mouthing others goes agains your integrity.

You are hurting others and yourself doing it.

Others will trust you less.

It will bring you more problems than sollutions.
