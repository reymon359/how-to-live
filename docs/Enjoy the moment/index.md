# Enjoy the moment

Remember to enjoy every moment of life because you certainly don’t know what will happen tomorrow.

When you are doing something, stop and think about it. Pay attention to what surrounds you and the people you are spending that moment with if you are not alone.

Don't think about the past or future, focus on the present moment and what is happening around you without judgment.

Avoid distractions to focus better on it.

Maybe the moment is not how you want it to be. Try not to force it, let the moment flow by itself.
