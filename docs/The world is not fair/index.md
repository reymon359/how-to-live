# The world is not fair

The world we live on is not fair.

Avoid complaining and blaming others for it. This will only stop you to do something about it.

Be proactive, adapt to the situation and look for a solution to our problem.

Don't compare yourself with others. Everyone has their own lifes with good things but also bad ones.

Take care of your mental health and don't feel angry or frustrated about an injustice.

> People who don’t expect justice don’t have to suffer disappointment. — Isaac Asimov

> We are conditioned to look for justice in life and when it doesn’t appear, we tend to feel anger, anxiety or frustration. — Wayne Dyer

> Look at nature to realize there is no justice in the world. Tornadoes, floods, tidal waves, draughts are all unfair... ...The world and the people in it go on being unfair every day. You can choose to be happy or unhappy, but it has nothing to do with the lack of justice you see around you. — Wayne Dyer

> Be a doer, not a complainer about injustice. For every injustice you suffer, there is a resolution that does not require you to be immobilized in any way. — Wayne Dyer
