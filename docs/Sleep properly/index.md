# Sleep properly

We need to rest properly at night to be ready for the next day.

Try to sleep what is enough for you, which commonly is around 8 hours.

Listen to your body if you need more or less sleep.

Here are some tips about Sleep Optimization:

- Stop watching blue-light devices like your smartphone for at least 1-hour before going to bed. Your mind will not be that excited when you try to sleep.
- Try to wake up with light, either sunlight or an alarm that fakes it. It is natural, and your mind will slowly leave the deep-sleep zone slowly, which is better than fast.
- Have the last meal at least 3 hours before going to bed. Your body will not be working to digest it
- Sleep in a room as dark as possible.
- Have a nice room temperature. Not too cold or too hot. This depends on each one's body's temperature.
