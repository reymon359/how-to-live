# Greetings before a conversation

Try to always begin a conversation by greeting the participants.
 
If you don't know what to say, a simple “hello, how are you?” normally is good enough.
 
The other person will see some respect and interest from your side. Normally, they will interact in a better mood with you.
 
When you ask about how others feel, listen emphatically to them.
