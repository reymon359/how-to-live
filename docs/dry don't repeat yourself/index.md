# DRY Don't repeat yourself

This one comes from Software Development.

DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, of intent. It’s about expressing the same thing in two different places, possibly in two totally different ways.

Don't repeat yourself (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Duplication is waste. Adding additional, unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount of work required to extend and maintain the software in the future.
 
This also works in life too, for example do not have extra items if you do not need them or already have one that fulfills that purpose.

## Quotes

> Foster an environment where it’s easier to find and reuse existing stuff than to write it yourself. If it isn’t easy, people won’t do it. And if you fail to reuse, you risk duplicating knowledge. ― The Pragmatic Programmer from Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
