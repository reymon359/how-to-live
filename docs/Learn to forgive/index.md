# Learn to forgive

To forgive is to change the negative feelings that you have about a fact for positive ones.

When you forgive someone you are not just helping the other person but yourself. You're being freed from all resentment.

Learn also to forgive yourlsef. You are not perfect, none of us is. We make mistakes like everyone else. Accept them and learn from them.

Forgiving is the solution to a lot of problems and the earliest you forgive, the earliest the problem gets solved.

If you really love someone and you have a problem forgive them. It is not worth to be upset.

Forgive a second time if necessary, however, be carefull forgiving the same mistake more than twice. In those cases just forgibing may not be the best solution.
