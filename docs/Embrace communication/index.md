# Embrace communication

I believe the majority of problems are due to a lack of communication, which means a lack of information.

And I mean all kind of problems, from small ones like a misunderstanding with a friend to national issues. Even in Software Development, most issues are due to a lack of good quality communication between the people involved in a project.

In the end, _the more you communicate, the better._ Actually, is not only the quantity but the quality of the communication.

The better you communicate, the fewer problems will appear and the easier the current ones will be solved.

Communicate with other people to truly understand and get to know them. Ask them questions and listen to them properly.

If you have a problem with someone or need help from them, just talk to them. Tell them the truth about how you feel about it. Try to find a solution together. There is no bad outcome of it, you either find a solution or at least clear up your mind; although things remain the same.
