I truly believe that most of the problems are due to a lack of communication. Which means a lack of information.

The more you communicate the better.

The less problems that will appear and the easier the current ones will be solved.

Communicate with other people to truly understand and get to know them.

If you have a problem with someone and you are just talk with them, tell them the truth about how you feel about it. Try to find a solution together. There is no bad outcome of it, you either find a solution or clear up your mind although things remain the same.
