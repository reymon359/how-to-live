# Embrace communication

I believe the majority of problems are due to a lack of communication, which results in a lack of information.

From small ones like a misunderstanding with a friend to national issues. Even in Software Development, most issues are due to a lack of good quality communication between the people involved in a project.

In my opinion, _the more you communicate, the better._ Although, is not only the quantity but the quality of the communication.

The better you communicate, the better the knowledge is shared, the more people will understand, the fewer problems will appear, and the easier the current ones will be solved.

Communicate with other people to truly understand and get to know them. Ask them questions and listen to them properly.

Remember, the most important part when communicating is to listen properly.
