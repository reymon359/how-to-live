# Take notes

Our brains are limited by the amount of content we can put into them. Therefore, try to take notes. Write down those things that you don't want to forget or need to do later.

Take notes of everything. Tasks to do, things to learn, recipes to cook, places to visit, music to listen to, movies to watch, etc.

Write them down for later moments when you may need to reach them.

Book some time to organize them and work on them. Plan it.

## Quotes

> “You have to make your own condensed notes. You learn from MAKING them. A lot of thinking goes into deciding what to include and exclude. You develop your own system of abbreviations and memory methods for the information.” ― Peter Rogers

> Why take notes? The obvious reason is to remember. Visual note-taking translates what we hear into pictures that give context, color, and meaning. By adding symbols, visual metaphors, likenesses of people, and room layouts, we add several dimensions. – Tom Wujec

> As a painter, taking photos is a form of shorthand - note-taking. – Wanda Koop

> He listens well who takes notes. – Dante Alighieri

> You can see that there is scarcely an observable fact unworthy of mention in your notes, and yet you could easily spend more time scribbling than watching, and that would defeat the purpose. So be selective, don't be compulsive, and enjoy your note-taking. – Robert Pyle
