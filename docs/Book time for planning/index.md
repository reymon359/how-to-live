# Book time for planning

Book time to plan. Try to plan your week before begining it booking time for it in the weekend. Even expend some minutes each evening to plan the next day.

When planning review your goals and split them into smaller objectives. Book time for those objectives.

Envision what you want in the future so you can work and plan towards it.

To be effective you need to act based on principles and constantly review your mission statements.

Do not just act; think first: Is this how I want it to go, and are these the correct consequences?
