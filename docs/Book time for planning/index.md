# Book time for planning

Most of the problems and lack of time can be solved by planning your activities (assigning a date and time).

Try to plan your week on the weekend before beginning it. Even try to expend some minutes each evening to plan the next day.

Split your tasks and goals into smaller objectives. Book, then time for those objectives.

Envision what you want in the future so you can work and plan towards it.

Use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix to review your tasks and assign them a priority.
