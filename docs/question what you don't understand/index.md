# Question what you don't understand

Make sure you understand things correctly.

Don't fear to question or ask for help about things you do not understand.

If you are in the middle of a conversation, and you are not understanding something, ask it. Don't just nod your head and agree to everything.

If you go on with something you don't understand without asking, it will be worse in the long term. Most of the time, soon or later, you will need to understand it.

Don't feel embarrassed about what other people will think. It is better to ask and understand something than to say you understand it and fail later.
