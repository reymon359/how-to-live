# Question what you don't understand

Don't fear to question or ask for help about things you do not understand.

If you are in the middle of a conversation, and you are not understanding something, ask it. Don't just nod your head and agree to everything.

If you don't ask and go on with something you don't understand, it will be worse in the long term. Soon or later you will need to understand it.

Don't feel embarrassed for what other people will think. Better to ask than say that you understand everything and fail later.
