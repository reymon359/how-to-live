# Practice mindfulness

Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present. To be aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.

When you are doing something, pay full attention to it. Put all your senses and mind into it.

The more you are aware of what is happening at the moment, the deeper you live that moment. Live each moment to the fullest.
