# Review your goals

Setting up goals is as important as keeping track of them.

From time to time, review your objectives and what you want to accomplish. Set up reminders to not forget it.

Split your big goals into smaller ones. Then, review them in different periods. If you have a yearly goal, try to review it each month, a monthly goal each week, and so on.

Review everything you do. Check if your actions are aligned to what you want and how you can improve. Seek help and look for feedback if needed. You should review your motivation too and if you are still interested in doing it. 

If you want to pursue new goals, just do it. However, try to not leave too many unfinished goals. Finishing your objectives will give you the motivation to move forward to new ones.
