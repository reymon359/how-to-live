Don't waste time procrastinating.

Your Erroneous Zones. Wayne Dyer - 1976:

Three neurotic phrases of the procrastinator: “I hope things will work out.” “I wish things were better.” “Maybe it’ll be okay.”

There you have the deferrer’s delight. As long as you say maybe, or hope, or wish, you can use these as a rationale for not doing anything now.

All wishing and hoping are a waste of time—the folly of fairyland residents.

You can do anything that you set your mind to accomplish. You are strong, capable and not the least bit brittle. But by putting things off for a future moment, you are giving into escapism, self-doubt, and most significantly, self-delusion.

If you spend your time complaining about how much you have to do (procrastination), then you’ll have no present-moment time for doing it.

You are not necessarily what you say. Behavior is a much better barometer of what you are than words. What you do in your present moments is the only indicator of what you are as a person.

By identifying why you procrastinate, you can begin to hash out a plan to avoid this and increase your productivity. It can be as simple as taking a 5 minute Facebook break for every hour you work, or stepping out to get some air at the end of a long period of focused work. Take a night off to go dancing or to your favourite yoga class, or spend your Sunday hiking or barbecuing with friends. Whatever you choose to do, strive for balance!

## Quotes

> Putting it off, in fact, doesn’t even exist. You simply do, and those things you don’t do, in reality, are just undone, rather than postponed.
