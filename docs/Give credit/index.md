# Give credit

Always give credit. 

When you use something that it's not yours, to its original author.

When someone helped you with something.

It is about being honest and keeping your integrity.
 
When you give credit to others, you are showing them respect and being grateful.

Include an acknowledgements section in a report if you need to credit someone.
