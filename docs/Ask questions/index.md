# Ask questions

Asking is one of the best ways to communicate and get to know someone, sounds obvious.

The more you ask the more you will know about the issue

if you have a problem or someone is having it ask to find the sollution

dont be afraid to ask again if you didnt understand something

you can even use a default one like "And what else can you tell me?"

ofc, listen properly to the answer, the better you listen the more you will understand
