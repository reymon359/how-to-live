# Ask questions

Asking questions is the best way to communicate and get to know someone. If you don’t know what to ask, you can use default questions like how is your day/week going? Or what are your plans for this week?

The more you ask, the more you will know about the issue. Ask questions until you have no doubts and everything is clear. This way you will solve the issue easier.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you don’t understand something. There is nothing to be ashamed of.

Listen properly to the answer. This mean to pay as much attention you can to it. The better you listen, the more you will understand. Don't be afraid to ask again if you didn't understand something.
