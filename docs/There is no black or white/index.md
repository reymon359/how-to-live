# There is no black or white

When making a decision, we tend to look for the good option because we don't want to fail or be wrong. However, the reality is that life is no black or white, there are no good or bad choices, just choices.

Therefore, avoid overthinking when making a choice. Just take action and make one.

There is no right and wrong. Be open-minded. People are different, and each one sees things from their perspective.
