# Don’t do something that hurts another person

Not just physically but mentally too. Just be kind, try to help them instead.

If you end up doing something harmful to another person, apologize and help them solve it.

We all make mistakes, and sometimes we can end up doing not on purpose. Don't worry or feel pity, it won't solve it. Just apologize and help them.

In addition, don't do things that hurt nature.
