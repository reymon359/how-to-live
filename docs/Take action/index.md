# Take action

To take action is to be proactive. Taking the initiative.

If you want to do something, take action and do it.

Stop overthinking and take action. The hardest part is to begin it. However, once you have already taken action, let it flow and keep on with it.

One of the best ways to stop worrying is to take action. To make a choice.
