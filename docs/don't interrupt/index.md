# Don't interrupt

If someone is focused on doing something, let them finish and don't interrupt them.

Don't interrupt someone when they are talking. Be respectful.

Listen to them properly, wait for them to finish, and then say whatever you needed to say. Most times you won't need to say it anymore.

Avoid the urge to communicate your opinion.
