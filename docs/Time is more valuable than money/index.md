# Time is more valuable than money

Always think if the time you are going to spend doing something is worth the money you will get from it.

For example, when looking for a job. If you have the chance, think about whether it is worth the effort and time spend there instead of doing other things.

Sometimes trying to sell something is not worth the time you will get from the item. Give it away or throw it in that case.
