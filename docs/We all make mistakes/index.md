# We all make mistakes
 
Learn from mistakes. Don’t feel bad about them, instead, feel good because the next time you will know how to act in that situation.
 
Every time you make a mistake, do not overthink it. Just say to yourself that "It’s ok and that the next time you will do better."
 
Things are not black or white. When you make a mistake, it is not really a mistake. You just did a thing. Saying it is a mistake is just based on someone else opinion. Sometimes it is based on your own opinion. Forgive yourself, you should not punish yourself and feel guilty.
 
Don’t worry about mistakes and things that can not be solved.
 
It is ok to fail, embrace failure because it is the best way to stimulate development.
 
There is always a solution. Find the best one and apply it.
