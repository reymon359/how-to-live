# Take responsibility

Take responsibility for what you do and what you commit to doing.

If you agree with someone to do something, do it.

The fewer dependencies you have, the fewer things you need to be responsible for.

Try not to blame and complain about things that are not the way you want. Take responsibility and try to change them.

## Resources and acknowledgments

Doing software development made me better at this. Realizing you have to be responsible and maintain whatever you create.

In addition, some books I read discussed responsibility and blaming, for example, Your Erroneous Zones from Wayne Dyer or Stephen R. Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.
