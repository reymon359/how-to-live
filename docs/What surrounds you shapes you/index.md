# What surrounds you shapes you

Surround yourself with what you want to be and how you want to be to help yourself become it.

There are multiple studies that certify that what surrounds us shapes our behavior.

Our network, the people we interact with, the places we visit, the location we live, all shape us and determine who we are and will be.

Think about what aspect of your life you want to improve, and surround yourself with inputs that favor it.

To become what you want, you may have to step outside the comfort zone in order to change your surroundings properly or even the location you live. Do it little by little. Try new places at the beginning and see what works for you.
