# Don’t feel bad about making mistakes
 
Learn from mistakes. Don’t feel bad about making them, instead, feel good because the next time you will know better how to act in that situation.
 
Every you make a mistake, do not overthink it, just say to yourself that "It’s ok and that the next time you will do better."
 
Things are not black or white. When you make a mistake is not a mistake, you just did a thing. Saying it is a mistake is just based in someone else opinion. Sometimes it is based in your own opinion, you should not punish yourself feeling guilty of it.
 
Don’t worry about mistakes and things that can not be solved.
 
It is ok to fail, embrace failure because it is the best way to stimulate development.
 
There is always a solution. Find the best one and apply it.
