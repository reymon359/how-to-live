# Don't waste time on social media

You don't need to avoid social media. When used the right way, social media is a nice way to keep in contact with the people we love.

What you should try to avoid is when you waste your time browsing stuff that doesn't bring you anything positive. You just keep scrolling for more useless content, procrastinating.
