# Try new things

Don't be afraid to try new things such as food, sports, activities, routines, whatever comes to your mind.

You may discover new things you like or discard them for future occasions.

Have an open mind when doing something new.

Don't over plan and let things flow. Be open to new experiences you were not supposed to have.

The more things you try, the more you go outside your comfort zone and learn and grow.
